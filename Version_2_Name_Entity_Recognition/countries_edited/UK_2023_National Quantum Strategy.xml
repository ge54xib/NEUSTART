<P xml:lang="EN-GB">National Quantum Strategy </P>

<H1 id="LinkTarget_1842" xml:lang="EN-GB">Ministerial Foreword </H1>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The first generation of quantum technologies created many innovations that we now take for granted in modern society, from the MRI machine to mobile devices. Yet there are lesser known but equally powerful inventions emerging from UK labs that could change our world beyond recognition.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">These inventions will improve the lives of everyone in the UK, from improving healthcare and speeding up drug discovery, to boosting economic growth and security and providing jobs. They will also help us tackle climate change, build a sustainable future for our children, and help the UK to respond to growing global volatility, as set out in the government’s Integrated Review Refresh. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Quantum rewrites the rules of classical physics, and in doing so allows us to do things previously thought impossible. Take, for example, exquisitely sensitive brain scanners that will reveal new insights into epilepsy or dementia, or sensors that let us see what lies beneath the ground from the surface. These are already being used in real-world settings today. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">In 2023, the government created the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) to deliver our mission to be the most innovative economy in the world and a science and technology superpower. Quantum technologies are at the core of this mission, not only as one of our five priority technologies of tomorrow – quantum, AI, engineering biology, semiconductors, future telecoms – but also as a technology that could release the full potential of every other on that list.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The UK is already a global leader in quantum technologies. In 2014 we set up the National Quantum Technologies Programme, the first of its kind in the world, to support excellent research and begin to take technologies out of the research environment.  The UK’s highly collaborative quantum community reflects that foresight from nearly ten years ago. The UK has world-leading strengths in quantum, including our deep research talent, the knowledge built up across the different quantum technologies, our rapidly growing quantum sector, and our strengths throughout quantum and related supply chains.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">We are determined to build on these strengths with vision and long-term funding certainty. This national strategy sets out our new ten-year ambitious commitment to quantum technologies in the UK. We firmly believe that Britain should lead the world in this physical science and deliver opportunities and jobs in hardware, engineering and advanced manufacturing as well as in software and applications across the economy. As part of our new department’s ethos of taking immediate action backed up by strong long-term planning we are more than doubling our investment into quantum by investing £2.5 billion in quantum over the next ten years, with the aim of attracting significant additional private investment on top of that.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">This ten-year plan will fund new frontiers of quantum research, support and develop our growing quantum sector, prepare our wider economy for the quantum revolution and ensure that the UK leads internationally in the regulation and ethical use of quantum technologies. We will make the UK the home for cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, the best place in the world to start and grow a quantum business, a leading voice in the international quantum and tech community, and a magnet for international quantum talent. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">We have worked hand in hand with the UK quantum community to bring this national strategy to fruition; I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this process. The hard work starts now to deliver on its goals together.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology </P>

<H1 id="LinkTarget_1832" xml:lang="EN-GB">Executive Summary </H1>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Over the next ten years, quantum technologies will revolutionise many aspects of life in the UK and bring enormous benefits to the UK economy, society and the way we can protect our planet. The UK has a world-leading position and quantum is one of the top priorities for the government, as set out in the Integrated Review Refresh. This strategy sets out our plan for the next ten years, building on the successes to date, to realise the incredible potential of these technologies for the UK. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Quantum technologies take advantage of phenomena at the atomic scale to find new ways to manipulate information. These technologies will one day make it possible to solve complex problems that are currently impossible to solve with even the most powerful high-performance classical computer and will allow us to reach entirely new frontiers in sensing, timing, imaging and communications. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Quantum technologies already offer possible solutions to some of our greatest societal challenges and, perhaps most excitingly, offer future capabilities that are yet to be explored. They will improve lives, drive economic growth and create jobs, and make us more secure. </P>

It could deliver on oursustainability goals by improving solar panels and batteries as well as cuttingthe energy demands of data centres. Over the next three to five years,quantum computing could deliver $5-10 billion of benefits across the world;and this rises to $450-$850 billion in the next fifteen to thirty years.

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Those countries that are amongst the first to develop quantum technologies, and use them widely across the economy, will have vast advantages in terms of productivity, economic growth, health, sustainability, and national security and resilience, not least because of the anticipated ability of quantum computers to undermine cryptography used to secure the internet. This means that quantum is a priority technology for the government, and one that will remain critically important for our economic growth, economic security, national security and defence. We are in a global race to develop and commercialise these capabilities. The UK was an early mover, but other countries are accelerating their own efforts. Investing in quantum now, building on the strengths that we have already established, will ensure that we deliver on quantum technologies for the UK. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_1822" xml:lang="EN-GB">Building on strong foundations </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">We have already made great progress in the UK, with a £1 billion investment in research and development from 2014.

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Government investments to date through the National Quantum Technologies Programme have created a unique and diverse pool of talent, capabilities and know-how within our quantum sector. However, given the pace of change globally and the challenge of bringing quantum into widespread use, it is the right time to set out a clear ambition and funding certainty for the next ten years to capitalise on this leading position and to accelerate the path to commercialisation. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">This strategy sets out a bold and ambitious approach to supporting quantum technologies in the UK across the broad spectrum of quantum computing, sensing, timing, imaging and communications. We will develop UK strengths across different hardware platforms, software and components, and reinforce our capabilities throughout the supply chains. Although international collaboration is an essential part of our approach, it is not in the UK’s interests to rely purely on others for access to these critical technologies. We will also invest in and strengthen the key ecosystem enablers, such as skills, infrastructure, regulation and standards. We will monitor the development of these technologies, both in the UK and in other countries, and the development of the market, to ensure we can flex our approach to deliver the best possible outcome for the UK. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_1792" xml:lang="EN-GB">A new ten-year vision, plan and commitment </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Our vision is for the UK to be a leading quantum-enabled economy by 2033, with a world leading sector, and where quantum technologies are an integral part of the UK’s future digital infrastructure and advanced manufacturing base, driving growth and helping to build a thriving and resilient economy and society. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">To achieve this, we will commit £2.5 billion to developing quantum technologies in the UK over the ten years from 2024 – more than doubling current public investment -which will aim to generate an additional £1 billion of private investment into theprogramme.

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">This strategy sets out a ten-year vision, plan and priority actions. As quantum technologies develop, the UK will need to make some key strategic decisions about where to focus efforts to realise the benefits from these technologies. At this early stage it is important to continue to build the science, grow the vibrant ecosystem, explore a range of technology platforms and parts of the supply chain where the UK has world leading strengths, in addition to focussing on software and use case exploration. But it’s also important to be more targeted where and when we can, working with industry to accelerate development within high value applications as they emerge to grow a world class quantum sector and deliver benefits for the economy and society.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">We will therefore develop our priority actions over time within the wider programme based on progress and wider trends, in full consultation with the UK quantum community.

<H1 id="LinkTarget_1632" xml:lang="EN-GB">Introduction: Quantum Technologies in the UK </H1>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_1633" xml:lang="EN-GB">What are quantum technologies? </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Many technologies that are part of our everyday life are based on our knowledge of quantum mechanics, from the lasers that are used in smartphones or for modern telecommunications, to superconducting devices which have revolutionised medical imaging.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Today, second-generation quantum technologies make the realisation of entirely new advances possible, based on the ability to generate, detect and control quantum states. We are on the cusp of a new wave of innovation that will offer a step change in performance from an unprecedented increase in compute power, to exquisitely precise sensors, and enhanced communications. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The advantages that these enabling quantum technologies will offer, alongside AI, high performance computing (HPC), and a broader suite of technologies, will transform how we interact with the world. Such technologies hold the potential to increase resilience, national security, productivity and competitiveness across many critical sectors including health, cyber security and defence and help tackle some of the biggest challenges that we face. Quantum technologies also pose potential national security challenges, not least the expectation that quantum computers will be capable of undermining the cryptography used to secure internet data. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The physical properties of nature at the atomic or subatomic level, and quantum systems, are both incredibly susceptible to outside interference (which creates exquisitely sensitive sensors or precise clocks) and exhibit novel properties (like the ability to link particles (entanglement), or for them to exist in multiple states (superposition)) which means they offer novel ways of storing, processing and sending information. Quantum technologies use these quantum effects to, for example, perform computation, create images of objects, sense the size, shape or movement of an object, or provide a timing signal. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The UK has an exceptional history in modern quantum physics, from the seminal theoretical work of Artur Ekert in the early 1990s that showed that encrypted keys can be secured by quantum systems, to the cutting-edge technologies now being developed in our research organisations and businesses. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) is a new research institution funded through UKRI, which is dedicated to accelerating the development of quantum computing by addressing the challenges of scalability and readiness. Working with partners across industry, government and the research community, the NQCC will create the necessary R&amp;D capabilities through coordination and delivery of a technical programme, alongside the commissioning and operation of new facilities. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The programme will deliver assured quantum computing capability, enabling the UK to remain internationally competitive. The centre will be headquartered in a purpose-built facility at the STFC’s Rutherford Appleton Laboratory campus in Oxfordshire, which is due for completion in 2023.</P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_1588" xml:lang="EN-GB">UK Strengths </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Today, the UK has a thriving academic and industrial quantum community. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Regional centres of excellence exist up and down the country, from the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) in Harwell, to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Teddington, the Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics in Glasgow, to our four research hubs led by the Universities of York, Birmingham, Glasgow, and Oxford. These centres and their communities have built wide-ranging networks, bringing together experts from universities, national laboratories, and industry partners to collaborate on quantum science and technologies. This ecosystem is widely admired and emulated by other countries as it has built a vibrant collaborative enterprise, connecting great research to translation and commercialisation.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The National Hubs in quantum science and technologies have claimed many world firsts since the programme began, such as the first industrial demonstrations of a quantum gravimeter (capable of sensing underground objects), the first chip-to-chip Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) encrypted transmission, and achieving world record performance in ion trap quantum computing.  The UK is in the top five in a range of metrics for global academic excellence.

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Quantum Sensors and Timing </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Despite our increasing ability to detect and monitor things that exist on land, sea or in space, we still often resort to digging or drilling holes to find objects such as forgotten pipes and cabling or to locate and measure sinkholes and mine workings. Researchers from the EPSRC-supported UK National Quantum Hub in Sensors and Timing and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) have teamed up with specialist environmental engineering company, RSK and Teledyne e2V to develop a new ground mapping technology, a ‘quantum gravity gradiometer’.  The device works by detecting variations in microgravity using the principles of quantum physics. This was tested outside the lab for the first time in 2022, successfully detecting a hidden underground object. The technology offers potentially faster, cheaper, and more reliable capabilities than current systems, with the opportunity to reduce the time needed for surveys, for example, from a month to a few days. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The programme has led to the successful transfer of knowledge and technology into many UK companies; generating and supporting around 50 quantum technology start-ups; nurturing a highly skilled quantum workforce, including over 470 PhD candidates and many fellowships; attracting more venture capital investment per capita into quantum technology than any other country.
<Link>12</Link>
 </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">New quantum devices that have been developed in the UK across computing, communications, sensing and timing are now being trialled globally, from wearable brain scanners that will improve our understanding of neurological disorders, to miniaturised atomic clocks that will end dependence on satellites for timing which is critical for everything from healthcare to navigation and financial services.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Recent developments in the sector show that the UK is an innovative centre for the commercialisation and deployment of quantum technologies. These include the launch of the first commercial trial of a quantum secured communication service in London, the integration of quantum gas cameras into monitoring systems in the oil and gas industry, and the release of a platform agnostic quantum computing operating system. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The UK is now home to the largest number of quantum start-ups in Europe.

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Other challenges specific to quantum technologies include: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-GB">•The technology is still emerging. For quantum computing, which is further from themarket than other applications, there is still uncertainty around which technical approachwill prove to be the most effective to solving the scientific and engineering challenge. It is also important to understand the interplay between quantum hardware and software, as well as supply chains specific to each technical approach, in order to build a strong UK capability. In other areas, such as sensing and timing, although a step change in performance can be demonstrated in a lab, it is not always clear when quantum will be the preferred solution in real-world settings. •We are still in the early days of commercialising quantum, with most quantumtechnologies in the research, development or early demonstration phase. Developingquantum products and services can be a long and challenging process, with the needfor sustained investment and support before profits can be made.</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-GB">•The quantum sector must compete with more established sectors to access packagingand fabrication capabilities, challenging when companies are having to undertakeexploratory design cycles in small batches. As with other deep tech sectors, the capitalrequirement for research, development and deployment of products is considerable.This challenge is likely to increase in the coming years as products get closer to marketand companies require more access to expensive infrastructure and commercial scalepackaging and fabrication facilities.</LBody>

At the same time this will give the UK quantum sector the best opportunity to capture a significant share of the global market creating jobs and delivering value to the UK economy. This means we must continue to develop UK strengths in quantum computing hardware, software and throughout the supply chain, which involves meeting significant engineering challenges.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Given the early stage of the technological development, and the fact that there are numerous platforms that could provide the path to developing a fully scalable machine, we will take a broad and ambitious approach to supporting quantum computing in the UK across the development of different hardware platforms, software, components, and all relevant supply chains. Although international collaboration will be an important part of our approach, it is not in the UK’s interests to sit back and rely purely on others for access to quantum computing hardware, so we will continue to develop UK strengths across the development of different hardware platforms, as well as software.  We will monitor the development of these technologies, both in the UK and in other countries, and the development of the market to ensure that we can flex our approach to deliver the best possible outcome for the UK.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">For quantum sensing, timing and imaging, our ambition is to develop the technology so that the UK is in a strong position to play an important role globally in the next generation of sensors and position, navigation and timing (PNT) capabilities, working with international partners.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">For quantum communications, our ambition is to realise both the potential of these technologies for secure communications where clear benefits can be demonstrated, as well as the opportunities they present for networking to help scale quantum computers, sharing information and addressing data storage challenges. Collaborating with international partners is a key element of this approach. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">As quantum technologies develop and use cases are fully demonstrated, the UK will need to make key strategic decisions about where to focus efforts to realise the benefits from these technologies. At this early stage it is important to continue to build the science, grow the vibrant ecosystem, explore a range of technology platforms and parts of the supply chain where the UK has world leading strengths, in addition to focussing on software and use case exploration. But it is also important to be more targeted where and when we can, working with industry to accelerate development within high value applications as they emerge to grow a world-class quantum sector and deliver benefits for the economy and society.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">We will therefore develop government actions over time within the wider programme based on progress and wider trends, in full consultation with the UK quantum community. We will report regularly to the National Science and Technology Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, and publish an annual report on progress. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">This strategy sets out how we will put this approach into practice through domestic and international policy to achieve our vision and objectives for quantum technologies in the UK. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_1529" xml:lang="EN-GB">Ten-year vision and goals </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Over the next ten years, we will build on our success to date by taking advantage of our world leading science and capabilities and supporting the continued growth of the UK’s quantum sector to realise the significant potential of quantum technologies for the economy. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Our ten-year vision is for the UK to be a world leading quantum-enabled economy, building on scientific excellence and creating a thriving quantum sector to ensure that quantum technologies are an integral part of the UK’s digital infrastructure and advanced manufacturing base, driving growth and helping to build a strong and resilient economy and society. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">To realise this vision we will set four goals: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-GB">•Ensure the UK is home to world-leading quantum science and engineering, growing UKknowledge and skills</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-GB">•Support business, making the UK the go-to place for quantum businesses and anintegral part of the global supply chain, as well as a preferred location for investors andglobal talent</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-GB">•Drive the use of quantum technologies in the UK to deliver benefits for the economy, forsociety and for our national security</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-GB">•Create a national and international regulatory framework that supports innovation andthe ethical use of quantum technologies, and protects UK capabilities and nationalsecurity</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The government has published a 
<Link xml:lang="EN-GB">Science and Technology Framework</Link>
 to build the UK into a Science and Technology Superpower, to help deliver stronger growth, better jobs, and bold discoveries to tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow.  The Science and Technology Framework has been designed in consultation with experts and practitioners across industry, academia and government to address the key challenges in delivering the UK’s Science and Technology Superpower ambitions. It represents commitment to a whole-of-government plan – introducing a truly systems approach to ensure policy, delivery, funding and messaging levers across traditional siloes are aligned and channelled to secure strategic advantage in S&amp;T as a top UK priority. It includes boosting investment in research and development, building on the UK’s already enviable talent and skills base, investing in research and innovation infrastructure, ensuring we regulate in a way that supports innovation and growing technology sectors.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The Framework also sets out a more systematic way of identifying UK priority technologies, with the first five including quantum technologies (as well as AI, engineering biology, semiconductors, and future telecoms). As such, quantum technologies will benefit from the wider use of government levers set out in the Framework. This National Quantum Strategy therefore focuses on the quantum specific activities that the government or others need to undertake, in addition to wider government initiatives, to support the growth of the sector. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The following chapters set out how we will achieve each of our four goals.</P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB"></P>

<H1 id="LinkTarget_1515" xml:lang="EN-GB">Goal 1: World-leading research and skills </H1>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">We will ensure the UK is home to world-leading quantum science and engineering, growing UK knowledge and skills </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_1516" xml:lang="EN-GB">Research and Development </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The UK is the home to excellent science and innovation, and nowhere is this more true than in quantum technologies, where we already have an established programme of public and private R&amp;D with over £1 billion of investment over the period 2014-2024.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The next phase of quantum R&amp;D in the UK will be even greater in terms of ambition, scale and impact. It will focus on securing and building on our existing strengths, as well as exploring new areas of scientific endeavour. It will provide greater support to the work of our researchers and businesses to translate, demonstrate and commercialise quantum research, driving development in key areas with commercial, societal or security value. This will ensure that the UK is a global centre of excellence for the long term.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">We will therefore establish a new and ambitious ten-year £2.5 billion quantum research and innovation programme from 2024-2034.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The future programme will be delivered in two 5-year phases, to be developed in full consultation with our partners across Government, most notably UKRI, independent expert advice and with industry. The core elements of the first 5-year phase will include: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-GB">•A new portfolio of applications-focussed Quantum Technology Research Hubs andCentres. These will build on the success that the existing hubs have had in building avibrant quantum research and innovation ecosystem. The future hubs will draw togetheractivities around a specific application area or theme, delivering strength and depth inquantum technologies and catalysing future growth and national capability. They willensure the UK is a global centre of excellence in cutting edge quantum science andtechnologies for the long term. These new Research Hubs or Centres will be formedfrom consortia of academic experts in quantum technologies and relevant disciplines,with additional collaborating partners from industry, government, or the third sector. Thehubs will also build the mechanisms needed to support the integration of theseemerging technologies into wider systems, led by end users.</LBody>

<LBody xml:lang="EN-GB">•Underpinning fundamental research: continuing to enable response-mode researchthrough existing EPSRC and STFC programmes to advance the science, and enablethe utilisation of quantum as a tool for wider research.</LBody>
</LI>
</L>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">We recognise the need to make a smooth transition from the current R&amp;D programme to the new ten-year programme. The current phase of the programme will continue to deliver world leading research through all existing core elements until 2024. Over the next year we will consult widely on the specifics of the future programme and will also make additional investments within the existing programme to support the transition. These additional investments include: </P>

<L>
<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-GB">•£100 million to continue to develop the existing application areas of computing,communications, sensing, imaging and timing through new quantum hub activities</LBody>
</LI>

<LI>
<LBody xml:lang="EN-GB">•£70 million in the development of two short-term quantum missions focussed onachieving key technological milestones around quantum computing and PNT.

</LI>
</L>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">For this investment of £2.5 billion we are expecting the private sector to commit to invest £1 billion into the programme over its lifetime. Up to now, we have achieved evenly matched industry funding from our innovation programmes. This takes account of direct contributions to programme activities only; the overall benefits and investment into the sector resulting from the programme will be much greater. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_1480" xml:lang="EN-GB">Skills </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Access to the right skills and talent is essential for excellence in research, technology development and commercialisation. Building a diverse and thriving workforce that can drive the growing quantum industry will be vital to unlocking economic and societal benefits in the future. This requires highly skilled people – ensuring the UK has the researchers, engineers, innovators, and practitioners it needs to have a quantum-ready workforce. It means postgraduate training, the development of technical professionals and apprenticeships, and attraction and retention of world leading experts in the field.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The quantum sector is small but rapidly evolving, with an expectation that skills needs will change over time. The call for evidence responses told us we are facing challenges associated with the small global talent pool for quantum-specific talent. A recent survey found that the top challenge for businesses in preparing for quantum computing was being able to access the right skills and talent.

<H3 id="LinkTarget_1414" xml:lang="EN-GB">Building a quantum-literate workforce </H3>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">As the sector scales, there will be a need for more emphasis on routes into the sector beyond doctoral training, as well as to build the pipeline from schools upwards. Professionalisation of quantum engineering skills will help talent to transition from adjacent sectors. To this end we will engage with UK professional bodies including the 
<Link xml:lang="EN-GB">Institution of Engineering &amp; Technology</Link>
 (IET) and the

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">We will ensure that the UK’s start-ups and SMEs can thrive in the UK. The growth of the sector is reliant on a steady flow of newcomers into the ecosystem and the ability of SMEs to grow their quantum business quickly and accelerate the development of their technology. The UK’s start-ups also require continued support to manage the challenging “valley of death” stage of commercialisation, where products are still in the development cycle and the company is not yet making revenue. Success is dependent on a critical mass of companies as well as the ability of people, knowledge, and ideas to flow in and out of this ecosystem from surrounding industries, users, and academia. Enabling all of this to happen will be critical to securing the UK’s position as a global quantum innovation hub. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">An environmentally sustainable and resilient UK: By mimicking nature a quantum computer could simulate new materials, accelerate improvements in solar panels and batteries, and help improve the efficiency of renewable energy sources. By modelling and optimizing logistics and traffic network flows, quantum computing could reduce carbon emissions as well as bring about significant efficiency savings. Meanwhile, by monitoring the emission of greenhouse gases, quantum sensors could help the UK to meet emissions targets and monitor compliance. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Strengthened security, defence and resilience at home and overseas: By solving complex optimisation problems, and sending information in a quantum state we could improve sensor networks for defence purposes and enable autonomy through enhanced sensors. We could use quantum-enhanced machine learning for pattern matching, image and voice recognition and classification, and data fusion. The use of quantum computing and sensing on the battlefield could enable us to find targets of interest and enhance situational awareness. Quantum computers could solve complex calculations for modelling and improving performance on the battlefield. Short and long-range quantum communication systems may provide high bandwidth, secure point-to-point communications which cannot be intercepted and can be covert on deployable platforms. Quantum sensing, timing and imaging capabilities could provide the next generation of  PNT capabilities to support troops on deployment, including in built-up urban environments where access to current systems is challenging. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The UK as a world leader in health and life sciences: By solving complex logistical problems, quantum computing could help make hospital systems more efficient, improving delivery and reducing costs. Quantum computing could also analyse vast and unstructured data sets to speed up new drug development timelines and reduce costs. Better, cheaper or easier imaging will enable improved diagnostics and outcomes for patients, for example, for use during cancer surgery to remove damaged tissue, or to monitor epilepsy in children, or brain damage and concussion. </P>

The NQCC will also examine key challenges around scaling quantum computing machines; verification, benchmarking, and error correction.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">SparQ Applications Discovery Programme </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The SparQ programme, developed by the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC), will help UK-based companies and researchers in the early exploration of applications for quantum computing. The NQCC is teaming up with Oxford Quantum Circuits (OQC) amongst others, to provide businesses and researchers with access to quantum compute resources including emulators, simulators, annealers and gate-based quantum computing platforms. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">While many government and research institutions around the world have developed programs aimed at raising awareness about quantum, SparQ goes further to take industry and government users through a journey from awareness, to engagement, evaluation, action and advocacy supported through four key elements: access to quantum computers, technical support and applications expertise, workshops and networking opportunities and learning resources. These elements are all aimed at allowing potential users to gain early hands-on experience in working with quantum hardware and algorithms to address challenges that are relevant to industry. Critically, the program is not just for quantum computer scientists and researchers, but also industry end users – people who are most likely to take quantum know-how and turn it into real world applications. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB"></P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_1041" xml:lang="EN-GB">Leading by example through government signalling and procurement </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">There are many areas where quantum technologies could improve public service delivery and enhance government’s capabilities – from improving the way we monitor climate change from space, to providing the ability to sense underground objects to speed up major infrastructure projects.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Government can act as an early adopter of emerging technologies to support technology development and demonstrate the value of technologies to other sectors of the economy. There are numerous examples where procurement has been used to drive innovation such as through the 
<Link xml:lang="EN-GB">Small Business Research Initiative</Link>
 (SBRI) and the 
<Link xml:lang="EN-GB">National Security Strategic Investment Fund</Link>
 (NSSIF), providing public service improvements for the government whilst supporting small businesses and stimulating markets. As part of NSSIF’s strategy, and to deliver insight and access to quantum computing for government, NSSIF has deployed £2.6m in R&amp;D contracts with quantum companies, helping to stimulate growth in the UK quantum ecosystem. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Defence is a key area where the government acts as an early adopter of emerging technologies. The MOD was a key partner in setting up the NQTP in 2014.  MOD has identified key quantum technology applications for defence, including sensing, imaging, and timing, as well as subsequent near-term opportunities in communications and computing. MOD has shared its own novel S&amp;T with the NQTP, while in turn drawing on the expertise within the programme. This has allowed the department to assess future challenges, understand applications and routes to exploitation, and ensure Defence is ‘quantum ready’.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The 
<Link xml:lang="EN-GB">MOD Science &amp; Technology Strategy</Link>
 also outlines the government’s intention to be an understanding first customer, an early adopter of innovation and a customer that’s prepared to take some risk – taking relatively immature technologies and experimenting with them within Defence systems. MOD will send clear messages to quantum innovators and potential collaborators on the military challenges identified which may be addressed by quantum technologies, while also welcoming and encouraging novel ideas and opportunities that Defence may not have yet identified. Government will work across departments to explore other key public sector applications and consider how other departments can learn from this example.  </P>

”) and industry ( “
<Link xml:lang="EN-GB">Secure Innovation</Link>
”), as well as wider advice1 is available through NPSA and NCSC. They seek to support the sector in navigating nuanced risks around state threats and the risks to collaboration, through a better understanding of due diligence on partners, identification of high-risk research or organisational key assets alongside appropriate security governance and risk management, which allows those organisations to make risk-based decisions about how to balance security with opportunity. This includes advice on undertaking security audits and mitigations with accredited risk consultants. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">ATAS applies to all international students and researchers (apart from exempt nationalities) who are subject to UK immigration control and are intending to study or research at postgraduate level in certain sensitive subjects. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The subjects and research areas are those where knowledge could be used in programmes to develop Advanced Conventional Military Technology (ACMT), weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) or their means of delivery.

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The UK’s export control regime, delivered by the ECJU, provides a consolidated framework to ensure that UK exports allow UK business to prosper without posing a threat to national security or violating our international commitments to non-proliferation, as agreed through treaty or multilateral export control groups such as the Wassenaar Arrangement. As is often the case for less mature developing technologies, there are few specific controls targeting quantum technologies themselves or the goods designed for research and development of such technologies. It is possible new controls may be introduced in the future as the technologies mature and their impacts are understood. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_918" xml:lang="EN-GB">Mitigating the risks associated with quantum </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">As with any new technology, risks associated with the use of quantum technologies will continue to emerge. One of the most well documented is the risk quantum computing will pose to national cyber security in the future by threatening the security of much of the existing public-key cryptography, upon which the information sharing and trust mechanisms of most modern systems depend.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is the UK’s authority for cyber security and cryptography and has published 
<Link xml:lang="EN-GB">guidance</Link>
 on the transition to quantum-safe cryptography, which is the recommended mitigation against this threat once products become available.  In terms of Government’s own preparedness, mitigations have already been put in place for critical information and services. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">NCSC will continue to give bespoke advice to each sector through its resilience teams, and general advice on quantum-safe cryptography via its website. More detailed guidance for quantum-safe cryptography algorithms will follow the outcome of the NIST process, recommending specific algorithms for representative use cases. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">NCSC’s guidance for mitigating the risks from quantum computing is set out within the White Paper 
<Link xml:lang="EN-GB">“Preparing for Quantum Safe Cryptography”.</Link>
 </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">NCSC’s position is that robust and secure transition will take time to plan and deliver, and there is risk in beginning transition to quantum-safe cryptography before standards-compliant products are available.  NCSC works with international partners to ensure our plans and guidance for transition to quantum-safe cryptography are aligned. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">There are actions organisations can and should take now to manage that risk.  Any organisation that manages their own cryptographic infrastructure should factor quantum-safe transition into their long-term plans and conduct investigatory work to identify which of their systems will be high priority for transition once standards-compliant implementations exist. Priority systems could be those that process sensitive personal data, or the parts of the public-key infrastructure that have certificate expiry dates far into the future and would be hardest to replace. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_902" xml:lang="EN-GB">Technical Standards </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The importance of standards is growing with the increasing globalisation of commerce, the emergence of new technologies and the need for interoperability. As technology progresses from initial research to prototype and product development technical standards become increasingly important, for example by supporting the consistent measurement of technology performance. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Different types of standards activity will be relevant at different levels of maturity: from identifying critical measurements and taxonomies as part of basic research, to the metrics and benchmarking of prototypes, and the interoperability and certification of commercial quantum products. Different quantum technologies are likely to mature at different rates. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">While supporting the development of standards will be important to advancing open technological development, interoperability and trade, these activities need to take place at the right time to avoid stifling innovation by setting boundaries and requirements too early in the process. There is also a need to mitigate the risks of standards being developed by those who do not share our values and in a way that does not support the UK economy. Engagement with key stakeholders and experts in specific areas of quantum technology research and innovation will be critical to Government developing an understanding of this balance. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">There are a number of early quantum standardisation activities taking place globally with significant focus on quantum safe cryptography and QKD, with UK leadership in these areas. Standards development organisations with activity on quantum technology include: International Organization for Standardization (ISO); International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC); International Telecommunication Union (ITU); Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF); the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI);  and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB"></P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Existing UK governance of quantum technical standards </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Quantum computing, quantum communications, quantum imaging and quantum sensors and timing are at different stages of standardisation activity and spread across several different International Standards Development Organisations (SDOs). The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has raised awareness of relevant standards activity amongst the Research Hubs, and has initiated engagement with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The British Standards Institute (BSI) coordinates UK engagement in quantum standards activity at ISO/IEC and at the European level in CEN/CENELEC. A BSI committee for quantum standards was established with NPL support in March 2021. So far its main activity has been to mirror and contribute to ISO/IEC/JTC 1/WG 14, Quantum Computing, and to the CEN/CENELEC Focus Group on Quantum Technologies (FGQT). </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Within government DSIT is responsible for quantum technology policy and for policy on digital technical standards, which includes standards for quantum and related technologies such as AI and telecommunications. Standards oversight and leadership will be provided by DSIT through partnership with NPL and BSI, bringing in other key organisations such as NCSC and NQCC in their particular fields. </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_890" xml:lang="EN-GB">Assurance of quantum technologies </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Users of quantum technologies and other emerging technologies require some confirmation of the reliability, cost effectiveness, safety and security of the products or services that they want to acquire. Testing and evaluation as well as wider assurance plays a critical role in demonstrating that the technologies do what they say they will.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">It is too early in the development pathway of many quantum technologies to establish full assurance frameworks for their use, however extensive work has been undertaken at NPL and elsewhere to develop effective testing and evaluation techniques, working with industry through ISCF Quantum Challenge projects and their Quantum Testing and Evaluation (QTE) Programme. This will stand them in good stead for the development of future frameworks.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The NQCC and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) are also working to develop open standards that build on benchmarking tools commissioned by the NQCC to enable comparisons to be drawn between competing quantum platforms. NPL and NQCC will develop an assurance and benchmarking programme of work to sit alongside the standards roadmap. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">Security assurance is as important as performance assurance to provide users with the confidence to invest in or adopt these technologies. As such, good security principles established by NCSC and set out in the Cyber Security Strategy 2022 should be adhered to and security must be seen as an enabler rather than an inhibitor or commercial success. By reducing cyber risks in their interactions with other businesses or users via the cloud, as well as ensuring quantum technologies are secure by design, quantum companies can maximise the economic benefits associated with quantum technologies. As set out in the Cyber Security Strategy, NCSC will work with the National Quantum Technologies Programme to develop a security model for quantum computers, which will help companies to design secure architectures, building on the Digital Security by Design programme and will continue to offer guidance to quantum companies to help them to operate safely on the cloud. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB"></P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The Quantum Metrology Institute at the National Physical Laboratory </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The Quantum Metrology Institute (QMI) at NPL was established in 2015 as part of the first phase of the National Quantum Technologies Programme. The QMI brings together all NPL’s capabilities in science, metrology and major facilities relevant to the understanding, development and test of quantum technologies. The QMI is a national capability for test and evaluation, accelerating the commercialisation of quantum technologies. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">NPL teams work in collaboration with industry and academic partners across the country focused on multiple scientific areas including quantum clocks, quantum communications, quantum computing, quantum sensors and quantum materials. Facilities are available to test and characterise materials, components and systems from the full range of technology areas. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">NPL offers schemes for industry to access these facilities and opportunities to collaborate with NPL scientists and engineers to address barriers to innovation, reliability and scaling of quantum systems. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">To expand these national capabilities in support of the quantum economy, a new facility – the Advanced Quantum Metrology Laboratory (AQML) – has been constructed on the NPL Teddington site. The AQML will give NPL even greater capacity to support the UK in the successful commercialisation and adoption of quantum technologies</P>

<H1 id="LinkTarget_872" xml:lang="EN-GB">Conclusion </H1>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">The potential benefits and opportunities of quantum technologies are vast and will offer advantages to the UK in meeting our economic, security, climate, health and societal aims. We are in a strong position to be a world-leading quantum nation, but we must continue to be bold and ambitious in our approach if we are to capitalise on our strengths and bolster our position in the global race.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">This strategy set out our deep long-term commitment to quantum technologies in the UK and the actions we will take to build on our advantages across a broad range of quantum technologies.  </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">To conclude, we will ensure that the UK is a leading quantum nation, building on the years of investment and progress already made in the vibrant UK quantum ecosystem. We will invest – at scale and over the long-term – in the cutting-edge science and the people who will deliver our success. We will support our quantum businesses who are driving the commercialisation of the technology and ensuring that the ideas and knowledge are translated into products and services that can be used across the economy to deliver benefits to all our citizens. We will work internationally to share and increase knowledge, build secure supply chains and collaborate on the most pro-innovation and ethical global governance and regulation of quantum technologies. </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">In the words of the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, ‘We will make the UK the home for cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, the best place in the world to start and grow a quantum business, a leading voice in the international quantum and tech community, and a magnet for international quantum talent.’ </P>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">At this relatively early stage in the development of quantum technologies, our approach is to strengthen the entire quantum ecosystem, by applying all the levers that the government has available. As the technology matures, and the successful technical solutions in particular areas become clearer, our programme might need to change and become more tailored. Engaging with the UK quantum community to understand what is working, and how the support needs to adapt, will be an essential part of our approach. We will consult widely on the design of the future programme.  </P>

<H2 id="LinkTarget_878" xml:lang="EN-GB">Implementation </H2>

<P xml:lang="EN-GB">To achieve this ambitious programme of work we will bring a rigorous approach to implementation and delivery.
