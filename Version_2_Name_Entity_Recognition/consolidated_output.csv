11,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"For example, quantum computers will be powerful enough in the long term to threaten the security of traditional digital communications with the cryptography that is used today."
12,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The migration to cryptographic procedures that are resistant to quantum computing is therefore inevitable and is something that already needs to be under consideration.4 Germany is in a good position in terms of quantum technologies.
13,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Because of its proven research landscape, Germany ranks fourth behind the USA, China and Great Britain in terms of relevant publications when looking at things on an international scale and it has the most publications of any European country.5 Germany is also in the top four for patent families, behind China, the USA and Japan."

67,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"2.Huge challenges, extraordinary potential Quantum technologies, i.e., the targeted control of quantum mechanical effects and their technological exploitation, promise enormous progress for applications in the economy, society and governmental institutions."
68,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Depending on the type of technology (quantum computing and quantum simulation, quantum communication and post-quantum cryptography, quantum sensor technology and quantum metrology, as well as the associated enabling technologies), the application maturity and its possible uses vary."
69,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Quantum computing and  quantum simulation The enormous potential is most evident in quantum computing.
70,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Traditional computers will reach their limits in the long term, for example, in the simulation of chemical reactions and compounds (material sciences, drug design) or the optimisation of complex systems, such as logistical systems."
71,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Through new algorithms based on qubits (quantum bits) instead of traditional bits, a quantum computer could deliver clear advantages in this respect."
72,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"There is also potential, for example, in forecasting weather services and the modelling of climate change and its consequences."
73,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Research has therefore been undertaken into a plethora of technologically different implementations of quantum computers (see also ‘Quantum computing’ info box) and possible use cases.
74,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"It is not possible, however, to reliably predict which of these approaches will ultimately be successful or whether different implementations will excel in particular use cases."
75,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"However, the technologies have the potential to create completely new possibilities for products and services in a wide range of application areas and industries, thereby having a significant impact on international competition."
76,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,In the long term studies are working on the basis of an annual market volume of several hundred billion euros in quantum computing alone.9 This explains the high level of attention being paid and the considerable financial commitment to the issue worldwide.
77,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Nevertheless, fundamental challenges still need to be overcome in the development of both hardware and software, which require long-term research and development activities."

79,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Post-quantum cryptography and  quantum communication Even though it is not a quantum technology itself, post-quantum cryptography plays an important role in this context."
80,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"From the IT security point of view, the development of powerful quantum computers poses a threat: the so-called Shor algorithm, a quantum information technology method, would be able to break the public key cryptography that is in use today."
81,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The quantum computing hardware that is required does not yet exist.
82,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"However, as soon as this is available, it would pose an incalculable risk since encryption methods such as this are currently used to secure confidential communications and security-relevant data."
83,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Even today, encrypted data can be hacked into and recorded so that it can be decrypted later with future quantum computers (‘store now, decrypt later’)."
84,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"This makes it imperative to develop and introduce new, quantum-safe cryptographic procedures (‘post-quantum cryptography’), which should offer a level of security against quantum computers at least as high as the aforementioned traditional procedures do today."
85,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,It should be noted that post-quantum cryptography can be implemented on traditional hardware in the same way as the public key methods currently in use.
86,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"This distinguishes it significantly from quantum communication methods and allows it to even be used in situations where quantum communication is not possible, for example, due to physical limitations."
87,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Quantum communication offers enormous potential to secure confidential communication in a highly effective manner.
88,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In terms of quantum encryption, quantum physical effects such as entanglement or the fact that it is impossible to create perfect identical copies of individual photon are used for key exchange in order to transmit data securely."
89,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Unlike common cryptographic methods, the high level of security    involved in quantum cryptography is based on phys-ical laws of nature and not on mathematical assump-tions."
90,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A wide variety of quantum communication methods have since been demonstrated in use, both in optical fibres and between satellites, and in terrestrial free-space connections."
91,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"For broad application rele-vance, however, it is the range and data rate that still pose a challenge."
92,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"This is why it is essential to develop quantum repeaters, which are required as nodes to extend the communication-transmission paths, as a key component for quantum communication over long distances."
93,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Quantum sensor technology and quantum metrology Within the field of quantum technologies, quantum-based metrology is probably the field with the highest technological maturity."
94,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"For example, nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond are already used in special microscopes."
95,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The first quantum gravimeters are also available on the market and enable the Earth’s gravitational field to be measured for applications in geology or geodesy.
96,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Quantum sensors also offer new applications that complement traditional technologies.
97,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"By directly referencing the measurement methods to natural constants, which are without uncertainties defined by the recent redefinition of the SI system of units (2019),10 they offer novel possibilities for reliable, ubiquitous and highly accurate sensor technology."
98,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Overall, quantum-based metrology is a heterogeneous field with a wide variety of technologies and numerous opportunities for promising applications, some of which are already ready for the market."
99,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"However, quantum metrology is not limited to quantum sensor technology."
100,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,It generally relates to performing high-resolution and highly sensitive measurements of physical parameters using quantum effects such as quantum entanglement.
101,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Quantum metrology therefore promises the development of measurement techniques that enable greater precision than undertaking the same measurements using traditional methods.
102,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"For example, electrical quantum metrology can develop conventional metrology into comprehensive quantum metrology."
103,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Among other things, programmable ‘quantum voltmeters’ are already available on the market."
104,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Enabling technologies The cross-sectional field of enabling technologies is particularly indispensable when it comes to further developing quantum technologies.
105,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"It is already demonstrating economic potential: the first markets for special lasers, control electronics and even cooling technology for quantum systems have already emerged."
106,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Highly specialised start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular can generate their first sales.
107,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The future challenge will be to develop innovative overall systems from this sum of individual components and to open up further possibilities of use.
108,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"As a cross-sectional task it is necessary from the outset to consider and develop an independent metrological characterisation and qualification of components11 in order to achieve a stable, trustworthy and reliable value chain in the emerging quantum technology industry."
109,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"This guarantees quality, comprehensible and firm performance parameters and the comparability of quantum technology components."

112,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"For example, major corporations such as Google and IBM currently represent the state of the art in superconducting quantum computing."
113,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"The USA also has the highest number of start-ups in quantum technologies (92), the highest amount of venture capital introduced (USD 2.2 billion from 2001 to 2021) and the most academic research groups (64).12 National funding is distributed among a wide range of national agencies and organisations (including NIST, NASA, DARPA) with different thematic and strategic focuses."
114,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Total government funding in 2022 was approximately USD 0.9 billion.13 When drawing comparisons on an international scale, China has announced the highest level of government funding by far with a total of USD 15 billion."
115,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Specific structures and strategies are less transparent, but important work has already been published at a scientific and technological level."
116,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"For example, an intercontinental key exchange was demonstrated in 2018 using quantum cryptographic methods and with the help of the Micius research satellite.14 With regard to quantum computing, there are also an increasing number of developments that indicate a high level of technology."
117,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,In the European Union substantial public funding for quantum technologies has now been announced (USD 7.2 billion within the EU compared to USD 1.9 billion in the USA).
118,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In Germany, EUR 2 billion of this is available for research and development in quantum technologies alone within the framework of the Federal Government’s Future Package."
119,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In contrast, however, there is considerably less venture capital available, especially compared to the USA (USD 0.3 billion compared to USD 2.2 billion)."
120,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In terms of scientific publications, the European Union is a leader, both when it comes to academic quality and academic breadth."
121,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"The number of start-ups has also more than tripled since 2015,15, 16 but is far below the numbers in the USA."
122,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,For Germany it is important to benefit economically and socially from the development of quantum technologies and to establish sovereign access to this technology of the future.
123,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"The initial situation is assessed as follows: Strengths  Weaknesses    ∙ distinct industrial sector with many potential usersof the technology  ∙ embedding in the European internal market  ∙ high level of public investment in the developmentof quantum technologies  ∙ strong fundamental research  ∙ good culture of collaboration between scienceand industry within the framework of cooperativeresearch schemes  ∙ ongoing research into almost all relevant technologyplatforms  ∙ established quantum metrology  ∙	 dual education system and strong university education    ∙ relatively little work in the field of quantum information theory (lack of research activity)  ∙ potential users are still reluctant to use quantumtechnologies  ∙ state of applied computer technology, especially inthe field of quantum computing, is behind that ofNorth American companies  ∙ when making an international comparison, there isless venture capital available and higher administrative hurdles regarding start-ups and their promotion  ∙ promotion of talents can be strengthened       Opportunities  Risks    ∙ Germany’s manufacturing sector could benefit disproportionately from the use of quantum technologies  ∙ good co-design possibilities for suppliers and usersof the technology  ∙ new markets for German SMEs as manufacturers ofspecial components  ∙ great economic potential through novel applicationsfor the communications sector, sensor technologyand computing  ∙ technological sovereignty in Europe can be fundamentally achieved through broad technologycoverage    ∙ skills shortage and brain drain, especially of topexperts  ∙ possible development of critical dependence onnon-European hardware and software  ∙ threats to Germany’s sovereign and critical infrastructures as well as leading technological companies due to the use of quantum computers by othercountries  ∙ lack of quality and confidence in the technology inthe absence of comparability and independent qualification of quantum technology components  ∙ standards are set outside of Europe and are notcompatible with German products       This rough analysis demonstrates the great potential for Germany due to its strong base in quantum technologies."
124,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,It forms the basis for the Federal Government’s measures outlined below to bring Germany into a leading international position in quantum technologies and to secure this position.
125,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Technology strands Quantum computing and quantum simulation While conventional computers work with bits that take the values (0) or (1), a quantum computer uses quantum bits (qubits)."
126,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,These are quantum mechanical systems that come in two states (0) and (1) or in a superposition of them due to the quantum physical effect of superposition.
127,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,This means that qubits can assume any combination of the two states.
128,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In addition, two or more qubits can be ‘entangled’ with each other so that they assume a particular common overall state."
129,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A change in one qubit will therefore have immediate effects on the other entangled qubits, even if they are spatially separate from each other."
130,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,This is a fundamentally different computing principle than that of traditional computers.
131,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Due to the enormous scaling with the number of qubits associated with this approach, quantum computers with only a few qubits are already expected to have enormous potential for certain computing operations."
132,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A quantum computer is defined not simply by the number of usable quantum bits (a measure of the size of the problem), but also by the error rates of an operation (it helps to estimate the quality of the result) and the depth of the implementable circuits (i.e., the computational sequences of the quantum operations on the qubits)."
133,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Circuits with many operations in succession (‘great depth’) enable more complex calculations to be performed.
134,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"The depth of the circuit depends, among other things, on how long certain physical states can be maintained ( ‘decoherence time’)."
135,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Quantum computers are intrinsically parallel and suitable for huge task sizes, while traditional computers only achieve parallelism through many functional units working in parallel and are limited in the size of the problems they can process as a result of their memory."
136,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"By using the quantum mechanical principles of entanglement and superposition, quantum computers are capable of handling certain tasks that push traditional computers to their limits."
137,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A quantum advantage can therefore be achieved with these tasks, for example, in the sense of massively reducing the computing time required, which in many cases makes a solution possible in the first place."
138,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Quantum computers should in general, and especially in the long-term, be regarded as special hardware for specific areas and not as a replacement for previous microelectronic computers for broad circles of users."
139,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The development of a practically-relevant quantum computer requires the generation and control of numerous qubits.
140,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"These must not lose their quantum properties for the longest possible time due to interaction with the environment (known as decoherence), although at the same time it must be possible to prepare, entangle and read them out in a controlled manner."
141,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"To this end a wide variety of physical realisations of architectures for qubits are being developed, from ion traps to electrons in semiconductor structures, superconducting systems to nuclear spins or photons and topological states."
142,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,All technical implementations have their own set of advantages and disadvantages and it is not possible to predict which of the technological approaches will prevail.
143,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Complex further developments of hardware and algorithms are still needed to achieve a universally programmable computer.
144,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Since many quantum algorithms react very sensitively to disturbances, the ability to correct errors is also a decisive factor here."
145,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In addition to robust qubits, special algorithms are also being developed to improve the efficiency of the hardware."
146,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In contrast to a universal quantum computer, quantum simulators represent a controllable system that can be developed to tackle a specific problem."
147,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"They are used to mimic another quantum system, thereby simulating specific processes."
148,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In this way quantum simulators can model practical properties, for example, in materials research."
149,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Quantum communication When it comes to quantum communication, quantum states form the basis for the secure transmission of information."
150,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,In this context quantum states are used for key distribution in quantum cryptography.
151,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"According to the ‘no-cloning theorem’, it is impossible to copy unknown quantum states or to measure them without interference."
152,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"This is why, with regard to individual quanta and entangled quanta, it is possible to determine whether the information transported with them has already been read out."
153,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,It is therefore possible to detect a possible eavesdropping attack on communications that were believed to be secure.
154,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Compared to previous encryption concepts, safety from interception of data transmission is not based on complexity assumptions of specific mathematical problems, but on quantum mechanical principles."
155,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Since quantum states are very fragile, a number of considerable technical challenges are linked to their transmission."
156,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"For example, quantum signals must be maintained over long distances and fault conditions must be reduced."
157,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In order to be able to make use of the advantages provided by quantum communication, it must be qualitatively and quantitatively tested in existing IT and communication infrastructures before being gradually integrated."
158,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In order to maintain the reliability and availability of communication infrastructures, quantum systems also need to reach a level of maturity that corresponds to that of traditional IT systems."
159,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"There are possible points of attack, such as the interfaces between quantum and traditional IT systems."
160,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In order to achieve future interoperable applications, as well as a standardised understanding of the security of quantum communication, it is also necessary to standardise basic building blocks such as the protocols used, key management, the integration of quantum repeaters as nodes to extend communication distances, and other network elements."
161,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,A floating particle trap: helium plasma in the vacuum chamber excites the particles to glow.
162,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Quantum sensor technology and quantum metrology Quantum states are very sensitive to influences from the surrounding environment.
163,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In quantum computing and quantum communication, this means that qubits are very difficult to control for a long enough period of time."
164,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"But what poses a challenge in one context, can also translate into great advantages elsewhere."
165,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Nevertheless, it is precisely this level of sensitivity to external influences that can be used to undertake very precise measurements of underlying physical variables, for example, electric and magnetic fields, gravity or temperature."
166,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A fundamental idea behind quantum sensor technology is to use two states in a quantum system, whereupon the spectroscopic measurable energy difference of them depends on the magnitude of the external influence."
167,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Other measurement principles use wave properties of matter.
168,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"With quantum optics, the entanglement of photons allows extremely precise measurements to be taken and enables imaging in spectral ranges that were previously inaccessible."
169,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Quantum-based measuring technology can result in a new level of precision that cannot be achieved using traditional measurement technologies.
170,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,One challenge is to shield all environmental influences that could result in a false measurement.
171,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Quantum metrology is closely linked to this: it uses quanta to define units of measurement and for other extremely precise research.
172,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Quantum mechanics sets the ultimate limit regarding the accuracy of any measurement.
173,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Quantum metrology therefore uses quantum effects to achieve a higher level of precision than that which is possible with traditional approaches, or to make measurements possible in the first place."
174,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Quantum metrology, also as a result of SI units being redefined, further offers the possibility of drift-free, self-referenced quantum sensors that can be traced to the SI."
175,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"These can offer significant advantages compared to traditional solutions, for example, when used as (pressure) sensors in process automation, or quantum electronic components that directly realise the newly defined SI units and quantities derived therefrom, such as the volt and the ampere."

178,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,3.Top-level technology for creative power and technological sovereignty Quantum technologies are a future key emerging technology in which Germany is building a strong foundation.
179,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The Federal Government’s goal is to take advantage of the available opportunities and to establish Germany and Europe as world leaders in this field.
180,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Targeted measures will make quantum technologies usable for society and the economy while securing technological sovereignty.
181,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In this context, the Federal Government is guided by a long-term target image where an advanced state of technology and diverse applications will be established by 2036."
182,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Vision 2036 The development of quantum technologies from a future technology into a central key emerging technology requires a time horizon that clearly exceeds the time frame of this conceptual framework programme.
183,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"The Federal Government is therefore relying on a ‘research and innovation’ approach – also encouraged by the Expert Commission on Research and Innovation17, 18 to further develop measures and a long-term, sustainable promotion and development of the technology."
184,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In the case of quantum computing, a technology-neutral approach is particularly important until it becomes clearer which realisation of qubits is most advantageous for the further development of quantum computers."
185,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,It is also conceivable that different hardware platforms would be particularly suited to different applications.
186,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,In the long term quantum technologies should be established as a key emerging technology in a wide range of application fields.
187,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"By 2036, ten years after the end of this conceptual framework programme, our target image is:  ∙ Quantum technologies are core components in awide range of economic applications."
188,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"They makesignificant contributions to value creation in Germany and to dealing with the pressing future issuesthat face our society, including: ∙ Quantum sensors are established in a wide rangeof economically and socially relevant applications."
189,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"For example, the construction industrybenefits from the use of innovative sensor typesin soil exploration, while in medical technologyquantum sensors enable new types of diagnostics."
190,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Furthermore, with regard to informationand communication technology, improvedsignal processing is achieved through the use ofhigh-precision atomic clocks."
191,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,∙ Complex use cases are solved using universalerror-corrected quantum computers manufactured in Germany.
192,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Quantum computers andspecial-purpose computers, e. g., quantum simulators or quantum annealers, play a significantrole in several industries, such as the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, the financial sector and the automotive sector."
193,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,∙ Sensitive data in administrative services andemergency services are exchanged via internaladministrative networks based on quantumcomputer-resistant cryptography methods.
194,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Theinternal administrative networks follow secureand defined transitions to other communicationpartners.
195,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Sensitive data within critical infrastructures and the economy are protected byquantum computer-resistant cryptology methods, and in some areas they are additionallysecured by quantum communication."
196,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Locationsof economic, scientific or sovereign relevanceare connected via a secure EU-wide quantumcommunication network."
197,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"∙ German activities in the field of standardisationas well as significantly higher levels of accuracyin time, mass and current standards resultingfrom quantum metrology form the basis for aninternational quantum-based standardisationsystem."
198,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"∙ Quantum technologies are making their contribution to ensure that the German economy remainsone of the world’s ten most innovative economies in2036.19 Together with partners from the EuropeanUnion, we are technologically independent whenit comes to manufacturing quantum technologyproducts and applications or producing critical elements within international value chains (technological sovereignty).20   The Federal Government’s measures are divided into three action pathways: A young woman looks through a microscope."
199,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A.Make quantum technologies usable for the economy, society and state institutions Quantum technologies will open up a wide range of new possibilities: from the simulation of new active substances to bug-proof communication and novel sensors that detect unexploded bombs or enable navigation without satellite support."
200,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Against this background a targeted development of the technology is needed, one that always takes account of possible application scenarios."
201,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"This conceptual framework programme of the Federal Government therefore focuses on measures that stimulate, strengthen or accelerate private investment in Germany through public co-financing."
202,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Depending on the area of application, public support takes different forms."
203,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"To this end the Federal Government uses three complementary and coordinated funding instruments:  ∙ In the case of research-related topics that are ofconsiderable federal interest, research and development in companies, universities and research institutions is supported with subsidies through projectfunding."
204,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,These non-repayable grants are primarilyaimed at application-oriented project consortia thatcover the value chain from technology development to the end user.
205,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"∙ Through the targeted awarding of contracts formarketable products, the public sector acts as acentral anchor and reference customer for companies that develop and manufacture such hardwarein Germany."
206,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"An example of this is the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), which receives core fundingand procures innovative quantum computers for itsown use through research contracts on the market by awarding contracts worth around EUR 600million from the fiscal stimulus package."
207,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Positiveresults from previous tenders show that the novelapproach of DLR’s Quantum Computing Initiative has proven to be a good funding route for an entrepreneurial quantum computing ecosystem in Germany.
208,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,∙ The borrowing requirements of young companiesthat bring new developments to market maturitycan also be met through direct public sector participation.
209,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"With the new DeepTech & Climate Fonds(DTCF) that forms part of the Future Fund adoptedin 2021, the Federal Government is expanding theestablished financing instruments for start-ups.The fund, which can grow up to EUR 1 billion,makes direct investments in deep-tech companieson pari-passu terms with a longer-term investmentperspective, covering quantum technology andother areas in terms of subject area."
210,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Alongside theestablished High-Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF), theDTCF is an example of direct public-sector participation in venture capital."
211,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In order to focus on the ambitious techno-economic goals of the conceptual framework programme for quantum technologies and to do justice to the budgetary priority of private funding over public funding, the funding measures also successively take into account the increasing degrees of technology maturity as part of their framework conditions."
212,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The aim of the conceptual framework programme is to create a close network of actors who will establish the first products on the market in a timely manner by means of joint research and development.
213,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Germany can particularly benefit from a large number of potential users from many different sectors.21 The rapid and interlocking development of initial pilot applications as well as testbeds22 and standards will allow the technology to be tested in real use scenarios.
214,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The Federal Government can see great potential in the following areas in particular: A laboratory with a coating system for ion beam coating.
215,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Economic innovative strength  The development of quantum technologies has now progressed to the point that they will enter into a growing number of areas of economic life in the coming years.
216,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Looking at it in the long term, the successful application of quantum technologies is associated with enormous market potential for German companies, which can use them to offer innovative products and services."
217,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In addition to the development and distribution of the technology, a wide range of new opportunities for application are opening up across all sectors, from product development to service offerings."
218,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In the field of quantum sensor technology and communication, where the first products are already on the market, business can benefit both in sales and in the use of new technologies."
219,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"To this end the Federal Government will create the foundations for research and industry within the framework of this conceptual framework programme to  ∙ bring the first applications to market with lighthouse projects in quantum sensor technology, forexample, in the exploration of raw materials, thereconnaissance of construction ground or the useof highly accurate inertial positioning and navigation systems,  ∙ build up a well-networked quantum communications industry through targeted funding, frommaterials and components to module and networklevels, cyber security and software, and to bring thefirst application-ready quantum communicationscomponents from Germany to the market,  ∙ further develop the technology in such a waythat by the end of the term of this conceptualframework programme, possible applications forproducts in at least five different sectors are beingactively and specifically pursued,  ∙ create conditions for quality assurance in the field ofquantum technologies through quantum metrology."
220,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The application perspective in quantum computing tends to be of a medium- to long-term nature with a possible time horizon of five to 15 years due to greater development needs (see also ‘Technology Lighthouse Quantum Computing’ info box).
221,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"According to studies the application could first be established in optimisation problems in industry and logistics (e. g., via quantum annealers), subsequently in the simulation of chemical processes, in AI-based evaluation of large amounts of data and later in quantum cryptography.23  Experts predict that the real value creation will not be in the development of the hardware, but rather in its application in the next wave of digitalisation,24 which will affect numerous industries."
222,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in particular, significant economic potential can be identified, even at an early stage of development.25 For example, ammonia synthesis for the production of fertilisers and fine chemicals accounts for around one to three percent of global energy consumption and a corresponding process-related CO2 emission.26 Even an optimisation of just a few percentage points in efficiency level using improved catalysts developed with the help of quantum simulations would have a significant global impact on energy efficiency and climate protection."
223,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"The Federal Government will create a strong basis for quantum computing by supporting the targeted development of technologies and application possibilities (see also ‘Technology Lighthouse Quantum Computing’ info box): ∙	 In Germany and Europe, quantum computing is to beopened up for practical applications in business and society by means of open-technology development."
224,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"∙ The Federal Government supports the developmentof all components and levels of quantum computing that build on each other (‘full stack’), especiallyalgorithms and application software."
225,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,It is crucial toinvolve users at an early stage.

227,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"∙ A quality infrastructure for quantum computingwill be established, driving characterisation, comparability through benchmarking, standardisation,conformance and standards."
228,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Societal challenges  Societies around the world are facing major challenges: Climate change is a global phenomenon.
229,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Tackling it and dealing with its consequences requires action on a common global, European, national, regional and local level."
230,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A better understanding of the Earth system, the individual components of the climate system and the main factors influencing the climate, as well as the need to adapt to the expected or already foreseeable consequences of climate change, will help to discover suitable, tailored solutions to meet the challenges."
231,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Due to diverse international interdependencies and limited resources, securing the supply of energy is also a global task that has to be addressed in the long term at international, national and local level, in addition to overcoming the current energy crisis."
232,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The question of mobility is closely linked to these aspects.
233,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,A globally networked society and economy are inconceivable without mobility.
234,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Mobility is the backbone for the provision of essential goods, a prerequisite for inclusion, access to work, education and health care."
235,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,At the same time mobility is also fundamental to achieve equal opportunities between the sexes and for disadvantaged population groups.
236,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,All economic sectors are also dependent on functioning transport and logistics; without these it would be impossible to do business and sell and distribute goods.
237,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,In this respect there is also a double dependency on mobility and energy supply.
238,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Mobility therefore has a considerable influence on economic and social development.
239,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The current technology jumps have initiated a fundamental transformation of the mobility sector as well as the energy sector.
240,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"When it comes to health, demographic change, increased levels of travel, infectious diseases, and illnesses resulting from changing lifestyles and diets as well as climate change, are all constantly posing new challenges to medical care."
241,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Quantum technologies can make important contributions in these thematic fields and sectors: Climate research: With new types of quantum sensor technology, the monitoring of climate changes can be significantly improved in the medium term (e. g., changes in water resources using gravimeters for earth observation)."
242,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In the long term, quantum computing is also seen as having the potential to improve the situation in terms of simulating climate change."
243,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Energy supply: The energy supply of the future will be highly decentralised.
244,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,In this respect distributed energy grids and local renewable energy providers as well as private households will work together in a complex system.
245,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The interplay of supply and demand is a complex optimisation problem that quantum annealers and future quantum computers could be particularly suited to solving.
246,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Mobility: Improved sensor technology opens up new possibilities in various areas of mobility, for example, through improvements in position stabilisation using quantum gyroscopes (used in autonomous driving in road traffic, through to space travel)."
247,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In the long term, quantum computing can create new approaches for optimising traffic flows."
248,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Quantum technologies will make important contributions to hyper-connected, smart and autonomous mobility, which depends on security and stability in all its components and interactions, and is also based on real-time data exchange in rapidly increasing quantities."
249,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Health: The development of quantum sensors can provide access to improved or novel therapeutic and diagnostic options in medical technology in the short and medium term.
250,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,New imaging techniques in particular will be of great importance in laboratory analysis or intraoperative diagnostics.
251,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In the long term, quantum sensors can be developed for controlling prostheses, for example."
252,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The development of drugs or vaccines can be accelerated and/or improved by using quantum computers.
253,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Digitalisation and artificial intelligence: The development of system responses based on Big Data in areas such as personalised medicine, autonomous driving or control in urban infrastructure requires the use of rapid decision algorithms."
254,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,These hugely benefit from quantum simulators and quantum algorithms and can be superior to traditional methods in terms of performance and accuracy.
255,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,A young woman stands with a laptop computer in her hands in front of a screen attached to a frame.
256,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The Federal Government will drive forward the development of all technology strands.
257,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In particular, it will ∙ create new possibilities for medical diagnostics andimaging with lighthouse projects in sensor technology,  ∙ support the preparation of a European Earth observation mission to monitor climate change basedon quantum gravimetry/gradiometry and, for thispurpose, advance the development of the nextgeneration of satellite-based gravity field quantumsensors (up to TRL 5),  ∙ bring the development of optical clocks for satellitenavigation systems and quantum gyroscopes forinertial sensor technology to a stage where they aremature enough to be used."
258,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Security and sovereignty  The expected changes brought about by quantum technologies are likely to have profound consequences in the area of digitalisation and (information) security.
259,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"This concerns, for example, aspects of communication, cryptography and elements of sensor technologies."
260,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,There are therefore increasingly stringent security requirements on both an international and national level.
261,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Germany must master these technologies of the future in order to be able to act with sovereignty.
262,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Against this background, the Federal Government will create the conditions to ensure data security for business and public administration, security authorities and the Bundeswehr (Federal Armed Forces) by using post-quantum cryptography and complementary quantum communication."
263,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"For this purpose, the Federal Government will ∙ drive the migration to post-quantum cryptographyin Germany,  ∙ promote the development of quantum-resistantcryptographic systems and ensure their qualitythrough standards,  ∙ promote quantum key distribution as a technologythat complements post-quantum cryptography, aswell as quantum communication,  ∙ investigate the use of quantum technologies in federal/government networks and consider the implications for communications security in particular,  ∙ use lighthouse projects to drive forward thenetworking of cities as well as science and publicauthority locations with quantum communicationlinks,  ∙ promote research and development of quantumrepeaters for long-range quantum communicationlinks (>200 km),  ∙ promote research into the security of quantumcommunication in practical applications, analysisof potential attacks and effective countermeasures,  ∙ promote research into security technologies basedon quantum mechanical principles, for example,quantum effect-based security tokens,  ∙ help accelerate the agile certification of technologies linked to quantum communication andquantum sensor technology for trustworthy usein business and government by bringing togetherrelevant stakeholders,  ∙ provide the first infrastructure necessary for quantum communication."

267,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Nevertheless, many development steps are still needed before application maturity can be reached with a universal error-corrected quantum computer."
268,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The Federal Government is therefore pursuing this goal with a long-term development strategy (see also ‘Quantum Computing Technology Lighthouse’ info box).
269,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,This includes system development at all levels (‘full quantum computing stack’).
270,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In particular, novel approaches need to be found to scale quantum computing chips into universal computing units."
271,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In quantum sensor technology and quantum communication, developments are already more advanced and closer to being used."
272,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Nevertheless, there is a need for further research and development in the improvement of technological parameters, measurement methods and readout protocols as well as in standardisation and certification."
273,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"An additional focus is on improving the robustness, integrability, miniaturisation and applicability of the technologies."
274,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"To support the targeted further development of practicable systems, the Federal Government also supports research into enabling technologies, which are crucial as a basis for achieving further progress."
275,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"This includes materials, components and manufacturing technologies, but also basic modules for the preparation, control, manipulation and detection of quantum states."

280,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Setting standards Issues surrounding standardisation and norms will play a crucial role in the future development, mastery and diffusion of the technology."
281,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,In this way commercial enterprises can be supported by building up a quality infrastructure for quantum technologies; ‘made in Germany’ quantum technologies can therefore be used as a quality feature worldwide.
282,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,International standardisation committees define the specifications of new technologies and thus have a decisive influence on their design and ultimately on access to the market.
283,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Against this backdrop a strong commitment is required at the technological forefront to the development of a metrological quality infrastructure and the intensified continuation of activities already under way in this area.27 , 28, 29 A roadmap of the CEN-CENELEC Quantum Technology Focus Group analyses the standardisation needs in this area and proposes a coherent framework that enables effective standardisation in all domains (computing, communication, sensing) and helps avoid duplication."
284,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Specific examples form characterisation parameters for components for quantum communication or for ion traps for quantum computers, as well as initial approaches for quantum computer benchmarking."
285,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Based on this preliminary work, a Joint Technical Committee JTC 22 was recently set up at CEN-CENELEC, as requested by DIN."
286,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"The increased number of international activities in the field of quantum technologies and related areas are already reflected in the first standard-setting activities.30, 31 In this context an important role is taken up by the development of suitable benchmarks and characterisations of quantum technology components so that quantitative comparisons of performance can be made across architectures and technologies, particularly in the field of quantum computing."
287,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Initial approaches are currently taking place at DIN.32 An independent qualification of components is also an important prerequisite for stable value chains and therefore for tapping economic potential.
288,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Furthermore, an infrastructure such as this helps to build trust in quantum technologies and prevents overblown expectations."
289,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Standardisation requires the companies involved to interact on an equal footing, to expect significant economic benefits from the results and to have sufficient financial and human resources to carry out intensive committee work."
290,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The influence of a particular economic area in the international standardisation bodies basically depends on the number and influence of such companies as these.
291,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Against this background the Federal Government, in cooperation with its European partners, will work towards greater German and European involvement in the standardisation bodies."
292,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"By promoting an entrepreneurial ecosystem for quantum technologies, conditions for work on standardisation and norms are ultimately supported in a targeted manner."
293,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"The need for standards that have already been identified in the first stages,33  e. g., for relevant parameters of quantum technology components for ‘reliable data sheets’, provide the basis for  harmonised and jointly developed characterisation and qualification at a European level, as well as the use of testbeds.34, 35 The Federal Government will therefore ∙ support standardisation activities in the field ofquantum technologies and work towards strongerGerman and European involvement in standardisation bodies,  ∙ build a quality infrastructure for quantum technologies that creates an advantage for the emergingquantum industry in Germany through objective,independent characterisation, qualification andstandardisation of quantum technology components and comparative benchmarks for quantumcomputers, independent of the architecture."

295,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Technology lighthouse: quantum computing  Compared to the other branches of quantum technologies, quantum computing is expected to have the highest potential for disruption in applications.36 At the same time the technology is still at a comparatively early stage."
296,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,It is true that the first quantum computers are already capable of performing simple computing operations.
297,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"However, these systems still have limited computing power, are error-prone and can only be used for special tasks."
298,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,The full potential of the technology can only be realised when a universally programmable and error-corrected quantum computer is available and can be used alongside existing computer architectures.
299,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Numerous further development stages are necessary for this.37 Experts estimate that the necessary stages will take at least ten to fifteen years.
300,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Economically usable interim results in the areas of application can be expected before then, within the next five to fifteen years.38 In view of the technological uncertainties these time scales represent an initial rough estimate that accounts for forecasts from public institutions39 and industry40, 41, 42 and the pace of development to date."
301,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Today, cutting-edge technology is organised into global value chains."
302,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In technically demanding areas that require high levels of investment, the available economic resources can be a limiting factor that makes international cooperation necessary."
303,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,At the same time the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine have highlighted how fragile and vulnerable global supply chains can be and how the value of global technological sovereignty in an uncertain world has changed.

350,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In addition, there is a need for realistic expectations regarding the potential, the pace of development as well as the limits of the technology, especially among decision-makers from business and politics."
351,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,Information that can be understood by all parties concerned and specific knowledge about applications of quantum technologies are therefore also needed in general and school education.
352,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Bottlenecks in recruiting suitable academic specialists are already becoming apparent today.49 Consequently, it is hugely important to look at ways in which information can be shared in a manner that is appropriate for the target group."

407,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Furthermore, the Framework Partnership Agreement for ‘open testing and experimentation’ was launched, which aims to bring together European testbeds on quantum technologies.64 In the field of standardisation, the publication of the roadmap on standardisation needs of the European CEN-CENELEC is expected.65, 66  Specifically in terms of technological sovereignty, it is important that close coordination with European partners continues."
408,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Especially in quantum computing and quantum communication, the aim is to achieve a leading position with European partners in terms of global competition and to position Europe as a technology provider."
409,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,This should also prevent Europe from falling into critical dependencies.67 The German government is strengthening these European initiatives through targeted bilateral and multilateral activities with partners.
410,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A prerequisite for these initiatives is that they ∙ allow cooperation by ensuring they meet our valuesand take place on a level playing field,  ∙ are conducive to the goal of technological sovereignty, and  ∙ are on the basis of mutual added value of cooperation through the complementary addition ofcompetences and technologies."
411,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In combination with national and European activities, it is possible to engender targeted momentum and thereby strengthen the ecosystem."
412,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In addition to the targeted strengthening of collaborations, the danger of expertise exiting to non-European countries must also be taken seriously."
413,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Against this context the Federal Government is pursuing various approaches in its measures to prevent the loss of technological expertise in this technology of the future, for example, through the instrument of back-licensing for contractors within the framework of the DLR’s Quantum Computing Initiative, through corresponding project funding regulations and through measures within the framework of foreign trade law."
