Talent: Building a world-leading workforce Developing, attracting and retaining talent are critical for Canada to succeed in quantum science and technology. The talent shortages already faced by industry and research institutions will intensify as more quantum technologies, products and services become available for broader use. While research and technical talent is critical, growing Canada’s national ecosystem will also require efforts to build and retain a cross-disciplinary quantumliterate workforce from diverse backgrounds. This includes business and marketing talent that can support sector growth, and university and collegetrained talent that can apply quantum technologies across the economy. There is also a need to develop complementary social science and humanitiesrelated skills to ensure that the advantages arising from the use of quantum technologies can benefit all Canadians in a fair and equitable way. Amid a growing international demand for a limited pool of talent, Canada faces the particular challenges of retaining the talent it has developed and building a more diverse and inclusive quantum workforce. Actions to date Canada’s quantum talent is being sought the world over. Canadian universities have taken the lead in developing talent and attracting global researchers"

Recognizing the importance of all levels of quantum talent on industrial success, universities have bolstered efforts to develop the talent pipeline by equipping students with industry-relevant quantum competencies at an earlier stage. For example, the Université de Sherbrooke has launched a Bachelor in Quantum Science program to develop students early in their careers. The Institute for Quantum Computing has launched a new Master of Science in Physics with a specialization in Quantum Technology to arm students with the skills to drive the deployment of quantum technologies. To expand quantum computer-related training, the Institut Quantique and the Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute have jointly launched the first Pan-Canadian virtual workshop in quantum programming. Other investments have supported quantum talent development and knowledge mobilization. For example, in 2019–20, the Government of Canada supported talent mobilization in the quantum sector via more than $3 million in Mitacs internships. NSERC CREATE has also been successfully used to build quantum talent by supporting training experiences relevant to academic and non-academic careers. Four quantum-focused CREATE initiatives funded from 2010 to 2018 collectively supported 306 trainees. Research funding is also critical to training, as the majority of research funding goes to support the efforts of research trainees at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. Larger-scale research awards also contribute to the attraction and development of quantum talent.

For example, Mitacs Accelerate International supports bilateral research collaborations between interns, universities and industry partners in Canada and abroad, allowing trainees from partner countries to undertake projects in Canada. The Government of Canada is also providing $5.4 million over six years to NSERC CREATE toward developing research skills; training in areas such as professional skills, communication and collaboration; and mentoring activities for trainees. These initiatives will involve a group of accomplished researchers who work collaboratively to offer a defined research training program to trainees in areas aligned with NQS priorities. Stakeholders stressed the importance of linkages to international pools of talent to complement Canadian strengths. Alliance International grants will enable academic Canadian researchers to work with international trainees to further academic-led projects. Additionally, several federal departments, including Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and Global Affairs Canada (GAC), are working to attract quantum talent to Canada by including quantum expertise in the list of desired qualifications. Beyond the NQS, other Government of Canada funding has the opportunity to support research related to quantum technologies. For instance, Budget 2022 proposed $17.7 million over five years, starting in 2022–23, and $5.5 million thereafter until 2031–32, for the CSE to establish a unique research chair program to fund academics to conduct research on cutting-edge technologies relevant to CSE’s activities such as quantum technologies and AI. Improving diversity in the talent pool To ensure Canada benefits from the perspectives of a diverse pool of talent, it is critical to make diversity and inclusion hallmarks of talent efforts under the NQS.

The Government of Canada commits to fostering the full spectrum of ways it can address representation imbalances and support the people and communities who will advance quantum science and technologies. As approaches are being considered, NQS programs will pursue incremental gains in representation by implementing gender-based analysis approaches to equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI). Given current realities and a highly competitive international market for talent, sustained effort over time will be required to realize meaningful progress and will be a key consideration in the development of roadmaps under the NQS missions. At the early stages of the talent pipeline, initiatives include Let’s Talk Science, a program to promote youth skills development and engagement in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Since 2015, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) has provided $22.5 million to enable the organization to deliver STEMbased programming for early years to grade 12 youth, build career awareness among students and teachers, and offer career-building volunteer opportunities to post-secondary students. These types of activities will be essential to growing expertise in quantum technologies among people of all communities, and establishing a pipeline to supply the research and businesses sectors. Additionally, the program’s broad community-based approach encourages youth from under-represented groups, such as girls, Indigenous youth, youth with disabilities, at-risk youth, and those in rural or remote locations, to develop life-long learning habits and curiosity toward STEM fields such as quantum science and technologies. NSERC, through the Tri-Agency EDI Action Plan, aims to support equitable access to funding opportunities for all researchers and students. For example, Alliance and CREATE funding opportunities require grantees"
0,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,22,1,"to report on practices that support EDI. Alliance grants also include EDI as an integral consideration in the assessment of applications. The Perimeter Institute’s initiatives to enhance EDI in theoretical physics and related fields include the Perimeter Scholars International Masters program and the International Summer School for Young Physicists, which have trained nearly equal numbers of participants across genders. To attract and retain more students, Perimeter is also launching the PSI START program, which aims to increase the numbers of undergraduate students from under-represented groups who pursue further studies in physics. The program will offer online schooling, as well as opportunities for a select number of trainees to participate in research with scientists at Perimeter. Commercialization: Translating research into commercial outcomes Driven by the development of new technologies that promise economic and societal benefits, many nations around the world are pursuing the commercial development of quantum technologies.

Exploiting the potential of quantum technologies for Germany New technologies have a huge impact on our everyday lives: they form the basis for a wide range of possibilities within the digital world, the foundation for the effective generation of energy, new forms of mobility and innovative medical technology. For a future-proof and technologically sovereign Germany, it is crucial to identify upcoming technologies and their potential as early as possible, to create excellent framework conditions for their future design and use, and to actively shape technology leaps. Quantum technologies are a future technology that have the po­ tential to disrupt and offer particularly promising prospects for use. Although they are still at a comparatively early development stage, innovative uses within the economy and society are already emerging, which also address the challenges noted above."
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,3,1,"The time horizon as well as the expected impact of the various key technologies involved in quantum technologies are different:1 with regard to enabling technologies and core components for quantum technologies, there is already a corporate landscape of start-ups and large companies within Germany. The first products related to quantum sensor technology, quantum materials and quantum communication have also reached market maturity. In contrast, quantum computing is only expected to be widely used in the medium to long term, although it does offer enormous development potential.2, 3 Like any other new technology, quantum technologies not only provide opportunities but also challenges, and it is important to keep track of them. For example, quan­ tum computers will be powerful enough in the long term to threaten the security of traditional digital communications with the cryptography that is used today. The migration to cryptographic procedures that are resistant to quantum computing is therefore inevitable and is something that already needs to be under consideration.4 Germany is in a good position in terms of quantum technologies. Because of its proven research landscape, Germany ranks fourth behind the USA, China and Great Britain in terms of relevant publications when looking at things on an international scale and it has the most publications of any European country.5 Ger­ many is also in the top four for patent families, behind China, the USA and Japan. The focus of German pat­ ent families is on quantum measurement technology and quantum electronics.6 It is important to make use of this strong foundation. Against this backdrop the Federal Government’s goal is to move Germany and Europe into a leading inter­ national position in quantum technologies through targeted, long-term support and then to further con­ solidate this position. In terms of quantum comput­ ing, the aim is to catch up with the technology leaders. This ensures technological sovereignty, increases val­ ue creation potential and opens up great opportunities for the use of technology in the economy and society."

1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,8,1,"Quantum computing and quantum simulation The enormous potential is most evident in quantum computing. Traditional computers will reach their limits in the long term, for example, in the simula­ tion of chemical reactions and compounds (material sciences, drug design) or the optimisation of complex systems, such as logistical systems. Through new algorithms based on qubits (quantum bits) instead of traditional bits, a quantum computer could deliver clear advantages in this respect. There is also poten­ tial, for example, in forecasting weather services and the modelling of climate change and its consequences. Research has therefore been undertaken into a pleth­ ora of technologically different implementations of quantum computers (see also ‘Quantum computing’ info box) and possible use cases. It is not possible, however, to reliably predict which of these approach­ es will ultimately be successful or whether different implementations will excel in particular use cases. However, the technologies have the potential to create completely new possibilities for products and services in a wide range of application areas and industries, thereby having a significant impact on international competition. In the long term studies are working on the basis of an annual market volume of several hun­ dred billion euros in quantum computing alone.9 This explains the high level of attention being paid and the considerable financial commitment to the issue worldwide. Nevertheless, fundamental challenges still need to be overcome in the development of both hard­ ware and software, which require long-term research and development activities. Post-quantum cryptography and quantum communication Even though it is not a quantum technology itself, post-quantum cryptography plays an important role in this context. From the IT security point of view, the development of powerful quantum computers poses a threat: the so-called Shor algorithm, a quantum information technology method, would be able to break the public key cryptography that is in use today. The quantum computing hardware that is required"
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,8,2,"does not yet exist. However, as soon as this is available, it would pose an incalculable risk since encryption methods such as this are currently used to secure confidential communications and security-relevant data. Even today, encrypted data can be hacked into and recorded so that it can be decrypted later with future quantum computers (‘store now, decrypt later’). This makes it imperative to develop and introduce new, quantum-safe cryptographic procedures (‘post-­ quantum cryptography’), which should offer a level of security against quantum computers at least as high as the aforementioned traditional procedures do today. It should be noted that post-quantum cryptog­ raphy can be implemented on traditional hardware in the same way as the public key methods currently in use. This distinguishes it significantly from quantum communication methods and allows it to even be used in situations where quantum communication is not possible, for example, due to physical limitations. Quantum communication offers enormous potential to secure confidential communication in a highly effective manner. In terms of quantum encryption, quantum physical effects such as entanglement or the fact that it is impossible to create perfect identical copies of individual photon are used for key exchange in order to transmit data securely. Unlike common cryptographic methods, the high level of security"

A wide variety of quantum communication methods have since been demonstrated in use, both in optical fibres and between satellites, and in terrestrial free-space connections. For broad application rele­ vance, however, it is the range and data rate that still pose a challenge. This is why it is essential to develop quantum repeaters, which are required as nodes to extend the communication-transmission paths, as a key component for quantum communication over long distances. Quantum sensor technology and quantum metrology Within the field of quantum technologies, ­quantum-based metrology is probably the field with the highest technological maturity. For example, nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond are already used in special microscopes. The first quantum gravime­ ters are also available on the market and enable the Earth’s gravitational field to be measured for applica­ tions in geology or geodesy. Quantum sensors also offer new applications that complement traditional technologies. By directly referencing the measurement methods to natural constants, which are without uncertainties defined by the recent redefinition of the SI system of units (2019),10 they offer novel possibilities for reliable, ubiq­ uitous and highly accurate sensor technology. Overall, quantum-based metrology is a heterogeneous field with a wide variety of technologies and numerous op­ portunities for promising applications, some of which are already ready for the market. However, quantum metrology is not limited to quantum sensor technology. It generally relates to performing high-resolution and highly sensitive measurements of physical parameters using quantum effects such as quantum entanglement. Quantum metrology therefore promises the development of measurement techniques that enable greater preci­ sion than undertaking the same measurements using"
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,9,2,"traditional methods. For example, electrical quantum metrology can develop conventional metrology into comprehensive quantum metrology. Among other things, programmable ‘quantum voltmeters’ are already available on the market. Enabling technologies The cross-sectional field of enabling technologies is particularly indispensable when it comes to fur­ ther developing quantum technologies. It is already demonstrating economic potential: the first mar­ kets for special lasers, control electronics and even cooling technology for quantum systems have already emerged. Highly specialised start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular can generate their first sales. The future challenge will be to develop innovative overall systems from this sum of individual components and to open up further possibilities of use. As a cross-sectional task it is necessary from the outset to consider and develop an independent metrological characterisation and qualification of components11 in order to achieve a stable, trustworthy and reliable value chain in the emerging quantum technology industry. This guarantees quality, comprehensible and firm performance parameters and the comparability of quantum technology components. An international comparison of the state of technologies Drawing comparisons on an international level, the USA currently leads the world, especially in terms of quantum computing. For example, major corpora­ tions such as Google and IBM currently represent the state of the art in superconducting quantum comput­ ing. The USA also has the highest number of start-ups in quantum technologies (92), the highest amount of venture capital introduced (USD 2.2 billion from 2001 to 2021) and the most academic research groups (64).12 National funding is distributed among a wide range of national agencies and organisations (including NIST,"

1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,12,1,"Technology strands Quantum computing and quantum simulation While conventional computers work with bits that take the values (0) or (1), a quantum computer uses quantum bits (qubits). These are quantum mechanical systems that come in two states (0) and (1) or in a superposition of them due to the quantum physical effect of superposition. This means that qubits can assume any combination of the two states. In addition, two or more qubits can be ‘entangled’ with each other so that they assume a particular common overall state. A change in one qubit will therefore have immediate effects on the other entangled qubits, even if they are spatially separate from each other. This is a funda­ mentally different computing principle than that of traditional computers. Due to the enormous scaling with the number of qubits associated with this approach, quantum computers with only a few qubits are already expected to have enormous potential for certain computing operations. A quantum computer is defined not simply by the number of usable quantum bits (a measure of the size of the problem), but also by the error rates of an operation (it helps to estimate the quality of the result) and the depth of the implementable circuits (i.e., the computational sequences of the quantum operations on the qubits). Circuits with many operations in succession (‘great depth’) enable more complex calculations to be performed. The depth of the circuit depends, among other things, on how long certain physical states can be main­ tained ( ‘decoherence time’)."
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,12,2,"Quantum computers are intrinsically parallel and suitable for huge task sizes, while tradition­ al computers only achieve parallelism through many functional units working in parallel and are limited in the size of the problems they can process as a result of their memory. By using the quantum mechanical principles of entanglement and superposition, quantum computers are capa­ ble of handling certain tasks that push traditional computers to their limits. A quantum advantage can therefore be achieved with these tasks, for example, in the sense of massively reducing the computing time required, which in many cases makes a solution possible in the first place. Quan­ tum computers should in general, and especially in the long-term, be regarded as special hardware for specific areas and not as a replacement for pre­ vious microelectronic computers for broad circles of users. The development of a practically-relevant quan­ tum computer requires the generation and control of numerous qubits. These must not lose their quantum properties for the longest possible time due to interaction with the environment (known as decoherence), although at the same time it must be possible to prepare, entangle and read them out in a controlled manner. To this end a wide variety of physical realisations of architectures for qubits are being developed, from ion traps to electrons in semiconductor structures, superconducting sys­ tems to nuclear spins or photons and topological states. All technical implementations have their own set of advantages and disadvantages and it is not possible to predict which of the technological approaches will prevail. Complex further develop­"
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,13,1,"ments of hardware and algorithms are still needed to achieve a universally programmable computer. Since many quantum algorithms react very sensi­ tively to disturbances, the ability to correct errors is also a decisive factor here. In addition to robust qubits, special algorithms are also being developed to improve the efficiency of the hardware. In con­ trast to a universal quantum computer, quantum simulators represent a controllable system that can be developed to tackle a specific problem. They are used to mimic another quantum system, thereby simulating specific processes. In this way quantum simulators can model practical proper­ ties, for example, in materials research. Quantum communication When it comes to quantum communication, quan­ tum states form the basis for the secure trans­ mission of information. In this context quantum states are used for key distribution in quantum cryptography. According to the ‘no-cloning theo­ rem’, it is impossible to copy unknown quantum states or to measure them without interference. This is why, with regard to individual quanta and entangled quanta, it is possible to determine whether the information transported with them has already been read out. It is therefore possible to detect a possible eavesdropping attack on commu­ nications that were believed to be secure. Com­ pared to previous encryption concepts, safety from"
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,13,2,"interception of data transmission is not based on complexity assumptions of specific mathematical problems, but on quantum mechanical principles. Since quantum states are very fragile, a number of considerable technical challenges are linked to their transmission. For example, quantum signals must be maintained over long distances and fault conditions must be reduced. In order to be able to make use of the advantages provided by quantum communication, it must be qualitatively and quantitatively tested in existing IT and communication infrastructures before being gradually integrated. In order to maintain the reliability and availability of communication infrastructures, quantum systems also need to reach a level of maturity that corresponds to that of traditional IT systems. There are possible points of attack, such as the interfaces between quantum and traditional IT systems. In order to achieve future interoperable applica­ tions, as well as a standardised understanding of the security of quantum communication, it is also necessary to standardise basic building blocks such as the protocols used, key management, the integration of quantum repeaters as nodes to ex­ tend communication distances, and other network elements."
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,14,1,"Quantum sensor technology and quantum metrology Quantum states are very sensitive to influences from the surrounding environment. In quantum computing and quantum communication, this means that qubits are very difficult to control for a long enough period of time. But what poses a challenge in one context, can also translate into great advantages elsewhere. Nevertheless, it is precisely this level of sensitivity to external influ­ ences that can be used to undertake very precise measurements of underlying physical variables, for example, electric and magnetic fields, gravity or temperature. A fundamental idea behind quantum sensor tech­ nology is to use two states in a quantum system, whereupon the spectroscopic measurable energy difference of them depends on the magnitude of the external influence. Other measurement prin­ ciples use wave properties of matter. With quan­ tum optics, the entanglement of photons allows extremely precise measurements to be taken and enables imaging in spectral ranges that were pre­ viously inaccessible. Quantum-based measuring technology can result in a new level of precision that cannot be achieved using traditional meas­"

Quantum metrology is closely linked to this: it uses quanta to define units of measurement and for other extremely precise research. Quantum mechanics sets the ultimate limit regarding the ac­ curacy of any measurement. Quantum metrology therefore uses quantum effects to achieve a higher level of precision than that which is possible with traditional approaches, or to make measurements possible in the first place. Quantum metrology, also as a result of SI units being redefined, further offers the possibility of drift-free, self-referenced quantum sensors that can be traced to the SI. These can offer significant advantages compared to traditional solutions, for example, when used as (pressure) sensors in process automation, or quantum electronic com­ ponents that directly realise the newly defined SI units and quantities derived therefrom, such as the volt and the ampere."

Top-level technology for creative power and technological sovereignty Quantum technologies are a future key emerging technology in which Germany is building a strong foundation. The Federal Government’s goal is to take advantage of the available opportunities and to establish Germany and Europe as world leaders in this field.

In this context, the Federal Government is guided by a long-term target image where an advanced state of technology and diverse applications will be established by 2036."
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,16,1,"Vision 2036 The development of quantum technologies from a fu­ ture technology into a central key emerging technol­ ogy requires a time horizon that clearly exceeds the time frame of this conceptual framework programme. The Federal Government is therefore relying on a ‘re­ search and innovation’ approach – also encouraged by the Expert Commission on Research and Innovation17, 18 to further develop measures and a long-term, sustain­ able promotion and development of the technology. In the case of quantum computing, a technology-­neutral approach is particularly important until it becomes clearer which realisation of qubits is most advanta­ geous for the further development of quantum com­ puters. It is also conceivable that different hardware platforms would be particularly suited to different applications. In the long term quantum technologies should be established as a key emerging technology in a wide range of application fields. By 2036, ten years after the end of this conceptual framework programme, our target image is: ∙Quantum technologies are core components in a wide range of economic applications. They make significant contributions to value creation in Ger­ many and to dealing with the pressing future issues that face our society, including: ∙ Quantum sensors are established in a wide range of economically and socially relevant applica­ tions. For example, the construction industry benefits from the use of innovative sensor types in soil exploration, while in medical technology quantum sensors enable new types of diagnos­ tics. Furthermore, with regard to information and communication technology, improved signal processing is achieved through the use of high-precision atomic clocks. ∙ Complex use cases are solved using universal error-corrected quantum computers manufac­ tured in Germany. Quantum computers and special-purpose computers, e. g., quantum sim­ ulators or quantum annealers, play a significant"

The internal administrative networks follow secure and defined transitions to other communication partners. Sensitive data within critical infra­ structures and the economy are protected by quantum computer-resistant cryptology meth­ ods, and in some areas they are additionally secured by quantum communication. Locations of economic, scientific or sovereign relevance are connected via a secure EU-wide quantum communication network. ∙ German activities in the field of standardisation as well as significantly higher levels of accuracy in time, mass and current standards resulting from quantum metrology form the basis for an international quantum-based standardisation system. ∙Quantum technologies are making their contribu­ tion to ensure that the German economy remains one of the world’s ten most innovative economies in 2036.19 Together with partners from the European Union, we are technologically independent when it comes to manufacturing quantum technology products and applications or producing critical el­ ements within international value chains (techno­ logical sovereignty).20"

1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,17,1,The Federal Government’s measures are divided into three action pathways:
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,17,2,"A. Make quantum technologies usable for the economy, society and state institutions Quantum technologies will open up a wide range of new possibilities: from the simulation of new active substances to bug-proof communication and novel sensors that detect unexploded bombs or enable navigation without satellite support. Against this background a targeted development of the technology is needed, one that always takes account of possible application scenarios. This conceptual framework programme of the Federal Government therefore focuses on measures that stim­ ulate, strengthen or accelerate private investment in Germany through public co-financing. Depending on the area of application, public support takes different forms. To this end the Federal Government uses three com­ plementary and coordinated funding instruments: ∙In the case of research-related topics that are of considerable federal interest, research and develop­ ment in companies, universities and research insti­ tutions is supported with subsidies through project funding. These non-repayable grants are primarily aimed at application-oriented project consortia that cover the value chain from technology develop­ ment to the end user. ∙Through the targeted awarding of contracts for marketable products, the public sector acts as a central anchor and reference customer for compa­ nies that develop and manufacture such hardware in Germany. An example of this is the German Aer­ ospace Centre (DLR), which receives core funding and procures innovative quantum computers for its own use through research contracts on the mar­ ket by awarding contracts worth around EUR 600 million from the fiscal stimulus package. Positive results from previous tenders show that the novel"
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,17,3,"approach of DLR’s Quantum Computing Initia­ tive has proven to be a good funding route for an entrepreneurial quantum computing ecosystem in Germany. ∙The borrowing requirements of young companies that bring new developments to market maturity can also be met through direct public sector partic­ ipation. With the new DeepTech & Climate Fonds (DTCF) that forms part of the Future Fund adopted in 2021, the Federal Government is expanding the established financing instruments for start-ups. The fund, which can grow up to EUR 1 billion, makes direct investments in deep-tech companies on pari-passu terms with a longer-term investment perspective, covering quantum technology and other areas in terms of subject area. Alongside the established High-Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF), the DTCF is an example of direct public-sector partici­ pation in venture capital. In order to focus on the ambitious techno-economic goals of the conceptual framework programme for quantum technologies and to do justice to the budg­ etary priority of private funding over public funding, the funding measures also successively take into ac­ count the increasing degrees of technology maturity as part of their framework conditions. The aim of the conceptual framework programme is to create a close network of actors who will establish the first products on the market in a timely manner by means of joint research and development.

The Federal Government can see great potential in the following areas in particular: Economic innovative strength The development of quantum technologies has now progressed to the point that they will enter into a growing number of areas of economic life in the com­ ing years. Looking at it in the long term, the successful application of quantum technologies is associated with enormous market potential for German compa­ nies, which can use them to offer innovative products and services. In addition to the development and distribution of the technology, a wide range of new opportunities for application are opening up across all sectors, from product development to service offerings. In the field of quantum sensor technology and com­ munication, where the first products are already on the market, business can benefit both in sales and in the use of new technologies."

According to studies the application could first be established in optimi­ sation problems in industry and logistics (e. g., via quantum annealers), subsequently in the simulation of chemical processes, in AI-based evaluation of large amounts of data and later in quantum cryptography.23 Experts predict that the real value creation will not be in the development of the hardware, but rather in its application in the next wave of digitalisation,24 which will affect numerous industries. In the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in particular, significant economic potential can be identified, even at an early stage of development.25 For example, ammonia synthesis for the production of fertilisers and fine chemicals accounts for around one to three percent of global energy consumption and a corresponding process-related CO2 emission.26 Even an optimisation of just a few percentage points in efficiency level using improved catalysts developed with the help of quantum simulations would have a significant global impact on energy efficiency and climate protection.

Societal challenges Societies around the world are facing major challenges: Climate change is a global phenomenon. Tackling it and dealing with its consequences requires action on a common global, European, national, regional and local level. A better understanding of the Earth system, the individual components of the climate system and the main factors influencing the climate, as well as the need to adapt to the expected or already foreseeable consequences of climate change, will help to discover suitable, tailored solutions to meet the challenges. Due to diverse international interdepend­ encies and limited resources, securing the supply of energy is also a global task that has to be addressed in the long term at international, national and local level, in addition to overcoming the current energy crisis. The question of mobility is closely linked to these as­ pects. A globally networked society and economy are in­ conceivable without mobility. Mobility is the backbone for the provision of essential goods, a prerequisite for inclusion, access to work, education and health care. At the same time mobility is also fundamental to achieve equal opportunities between the sexes and for disad­ vantaged population groups. All economic sectors are also dependent on functioning transport and logistics; without these it would be impossible to do business and sell and distribute goods. In this respect there is also a double dependency on mobility and energy supply. Mobility therefore has a considerable influence on economic and social development. The current technol­ ogy jumps have initiated a fundamental transformation of the mobility sector as well as the energy sector.

New imaging techniques in particular will be of great importance in laboratory analysis or intraoperative diagnostics.

This includes system develop­ ment at all levels (‘full quantum computing stack’). In particular, novel approaches need to be found to scale quantum computing chips into universal computing units.

1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,26,1,"C. Create excellent framework conditions for a strong ecosystem Create interfaces: strengthen ecosystems In order to make the new technologies application-­ ready and therefore usable within the economy and society, it is necessary to build a functional, compre­ hensive ecosystem. This includes fundamental re­ search, technology developments for users, the train­ ing of technical specialists or experts in engineering sciences, computer science and physics, as well as additional support measures for networking and the development of a metrological quality infrastructure. Germany introduces a number of strong players in all relevant areas. The Federal Government’s goal is to create close networking throughout all parts of the value chain in the form of an entrepreneurial ecosys­ tem. This should enable the targeted and, by means of synergies, efficient development of quantum technol­ ogies that are economically self-sustaining in the long term. The Federal Government is strengthening the quan­ tum technology ecosystem through the following means: ∙Direct project funding from the Federal Gov­ ernment is generally directed at consortia from industry and science. Project consortia that cover as many parts of the value chain as possible are funded. Through joint research and development work, close ties are forged between fundamental researchers, developers and users, and ideas are pursued in a targeted manner. The development of characterisation, qualification and standardisa­ tion of quantum technology components within value chains is considered from the beginning and included in the measures. ∙At the same time the entrepreneurial ecosystem is stimulated by collocated research contracts: for example, innovative quantum computers are procured for DLR’s own needs through research contracts. In the European partnership EuroHPC, which is co-financed by the Federal Government,"
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,26,2,"quantum computers are also being procured for locations of the Gauss Centre for Supercomputing in Germany; albeit with a smaller financial volume. With this instrument, more mature approaches in technological terms will be developed in the medium term by companies, especially start-ups. For highly innovative companies from the Europe­ an economic area, close cooperation with DLR also creates incentives to locate research, development and production in Germany. ∙Focused networking meetings, seminars and sym­ posia work alongside the research and development activities within the technology strands, enabling exchange and synergies across individual project consortia. Complementary to this and with the goal of creating a powerful ecosystem, is the provision of overarching exchange forums and seminars, the preparation of an accompanying analysis of the ecosystem and discussions about cross-cutting issues in joint workshops. This also ensures that synergies are created and the resources deployed are used efficiently. Strengthen start-up culture and innovative companies Start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises with strong research capabilities will play an impor­ tant role in technology development, while coopera­ tion models with large companies have also proven to be successful in this regard. The Federal Government supports young, innovative companies with this through: ∙Specific funding that allows spin-offs from uni­ versities and research institutions in the field of quantum technologies to transfer innovative ideas and move towards application and commercial exploitation,45 ∙The expansion of technology transfer in all facets at the level of institutional and strategic development of publicly funded research institutions, especially through spin-offs,"

Information that can be understood by all parties concerned and specific knowledge about ap­ plications of quantum technologies are therefore also needed in general and school education. Bottlenecks in recruiting suitable academic special­ ists are already becoming apparent today.49 Con­ sequently, it is hugely important to look at ways in which information can be shared in a manner that is appropriate for the target group. The aim is to increase low-threshold interest in order to inspire the skilled workers of tomorrow, as well as to demonstrate potential to users from outside the field. Employees in companies must be empowered to use the technology. And it goes without saying that there is also a need for highly qualified professionals, especially with regard to developing the technology further.

Within the framework of this conceptual framework programme these measures will be developed further alongside new ideas for knowledge transfer and the participation of civil society. The biggest challenge in the future will be to address and reach the differ­ ent target groups. Only then will there be enough skilled workers for tomorrow, the right decisions will be made in dealing with the issue and the topic will become accepted on a social level. One focus of the activities will be on increased support for excellent young personnel. This will begin with the networking of outstanding students and specific support for doctoral students, and will move on to targeted measures such as Quantum Fellowships or academic junior research groups for outstanding postgraduates who are urgently needed for technology development in particular. In addition, specific attention will be paid to young people who can provide the next generation of skilled workers in the emerging quantum technology market. To this end age-appropriate ways of sharing research-based learning that will encourage people to act upon it are being developed, for example, through participatory actions in schools. At the same time the further training of experienced professionals and technical staff from thematically related fields should be encouraged since this area is seen as being able to offer particularly good prospects for broadening the skilled labour base.51 Keeping an eye on impact: identifying opportuni­ ties and considering effects To build a technology of the future, new develop­ ments must be recognised at an early stage and strategically taken into account.

Due to the rapid development of the technology, the Federal Government is also in constant dialogue with the professional sector in order to be able to take new developments into account at an early stage. For this purpose, the opinion of expert committees with ex­ ternal expertise is sought, partly through fixed advi­ sory groups and partly through expert discussions on specific topic areas. In addition, a systematic, ongoing monitoring of the ecosystem will be set up as part of the accompanying research. At the same time the buy-in of citizens regarding the acceptance of new quantum technologies must take place alongside technology development. Direct and early cooperation between researchers and later users within the framework of participatory technology development will promote practical and needs-­ oriented technical solutions. From coming into direct contact with new quantum technologies in medicine, mobility and communication, to questions of resil­ ience and internal and external security, citizens and the economy, the state and society will be impacted in many ways by these new developments. So far, the discussion has focused on the opportunities and options provided by the technology. The risks that are currently most frequently under discussion come in the form of which development gaps exist compared to competing countries. However, as technologies mature and are applied, questions will increasingly be asked about societal and cultural influences, tech­ nology assessment and the prevention of adverse side effects."

Last but not least quantum technologies will have a considerable influence on modern cryptography. As soon as powerful quantum computers become available, the security of cryptography methods used as standard today will no longer be guaranteed. Quan­ tum communication can solve this problem through quantum-based key agreement.58 In combination with post-quantum cryptography based on mathematical principles, the confidentiality of sensitive information can be maintained in the long term. However, the new risks posed by technology, especially for information security and data protection, need to be evaluated, tracked alongside evolving technology, and effective countermeasures need to be designed.

The Federal Government will support this development with accompanying analyses and adapt and further develop its measures on this basis. Interdisciplinary interfaces The interdisciplinary field of quantum technologies has points in common with several other key emerg­ ing technologies. It is also important to be able to connect to existing technologies, for example, the embedding of quantum computing in the infrastruc­ tures of ‘high-performance computing’ (HPC), the creation of ‘software stacks’, or the embedding of quantum communication in modern information and communication technology, especially at the interface with artificial intelligence. In addition, further devel­ opment also requires technological advances, for ex­ ample, in the field of microelectronics, photonics and cryotechnology. This anchoring is ensured through joint projects in interfaces and the position it takes up in the relevant research programmes. Consequently, there are overlaps with various other programmes of the Federal Government or individual ministries, for example, in the field of microelectronics, high-­ performance and supercomputing, cyber and IT security or space research (see also Annex ‘Ministerial research programmes, strategies and measures with reference to the conceptual framework programme’).

To this end the Horizon Europe and Digital Europe programmes support research and development as well as the development of infrastructure. Networking between national and European funding measures takes place at different levels. For example, the QuantERA initiative supports transnational funding projects. There is also close coordination with the EU Commission, ESA and other EU member states, while the pooling of national and European funds for larger structural measures takes place, such as the pan-European procurement of quantum computers and their integration into an HPC environment in EuroHPC62 or the establishment of a European quantum communication network (EuroQCI)63 and its space component SAGA.

In combination with national and European activities, it is possible to engender targeted momentum and thereby strengthen the ecosystem. In addition to the targeted strengthening of collabora­ tions, the danger of expertise exiting to non-­European countries must also be taken seriously. Against this context the Federal Government is pursuing vari­ ous approaches in its measures to prevent the loss of technological expertise in this technology of the future, for example, through the instrument of back-­ licensing for contractors within the framework of the DLR’s Quantum Computing Initiative, through cor­ responding project funding regulations and through measures within the framework of foreign trade law."

This is intended to create a crypto library, tested in accordance with the current state of knowledge, for the deployment and use of post-quantum cryptogra­ phy for the purposes of promoting the widespread use of quantum computer-resistant cryptography. In the current BSI Integration von Post-Quanten Kryptografie in den E-Mail-Client Thunderbird [Inte­ gration of post-quantum cryptography in the Thun­ derbird email client project], end-to-end encryption (E2EE) that is resistant to quantum computing is being implemented using encrypted and digitally signed emails. For this purpose, the OpenPGP-based public key cryptography of the popular email cli­ ent Thunderbird is extended using encryption and signature methods from post-quantum cryptography. In addition to the implementation activities, a major part of the project is a corresponding draft on stand­ ardisation in the form of an RFC Internet Draft, which is intended for submission to the OpenPGP working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In the Quantencomputerresistente Authentisierung für VS-IT-Systeme [Quantum Computer Resistant Authentication for VS-IT Systems] feasability study, which will run until February 2023, the implications of authentication procedures that are resistant to quantum computing being placed in existing VS-IT systems and those that are under development, are all being investigated by an external contractor.

In particular, limitations such as the performance of the signature algorithms, crypto-agility as well as the migration capability of the VS-IT systems are taken into account in this feasibility study. In cooperation with the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the BSI has pushed ahead with the creation of an initial protection profile for quantum key distribution (QKD) modules in accordance with Common Criteria. The Protection Profile, which"
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,40,2,"is limited to taking into account prepare-and-­measure protocols and point-to-point connections, is now available in a first version and is to be certified soon. It represents the first stage in achieving an evaluation methodology, but requires the development of further standards and background documentation until actual certification of specific products is possible. Achieving a secure implementation of QKD proto­ cols requires a solid understanding of the possible side-channel attacks on QKD modules, something that has already been demonstrated for many specific implementations. To this end the BSI has commis­ sioned the preparation of a study that will present the scientific state of research on side-channel attacks on QKD systems in a standard and complete manner. This is a first necessary step towards the creation of an evaluation methodology for QKD side-channel attacks. In close cooperation with the ­Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt [National Metrology Institute of Ger­ many] (PTB), the BSI is involved in the coordination of the BMBF-funded Schirmprojekt Quantenkom­ munikation Deutschland [Quantum Communication Germany] umbrella project. The key goal of the Quantum Communication Germany umbrella project is to establish quantum communication as a technology that can be used in practice, is secure and commercially available in Germany and Europe. The BSI therefore focuses on taking aspects of information security (for example, the security of QKD protocols) into account at an early stage.

Their interest in both projects was a proof-of-concept pertaining to application scenarios using the quan­ tum computing capacities of project partners, which are currently being developed. In 2021, the Qu-Gov – Quantum Technologies for the Federal Administration project was also added as a result of a direct com­ mission from the Federal Ministry of Finance. With this, a top-down approach was followed, in which proof-of-concepts or proof-of-values are developed for use cases taken from the sovereign-administrative environment and then evaluated in a platform-open manner. By the end of 2024, quantum technologies for the federal (financial) administration will therefore be evaluated and researched, and initial use cases will be tested. The main topics are ∙Quantum information and security, ∙Quantum analytics, and ∙Quantum-related (data) sovereignty. The project works with partners from science, in­ dustry, start-ups and administration and relies on a collaborative approach.

1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,41,2,"digital topics such as the Federal Data Atlas and the Federal AI Competence Centre. At that time, Bundesdruckerei, together with DB Sys­ tel, founded the Bundesquantenallianz (BQA) in order to research quantum technologies that went beyond the scope of the project on behalf of the federal ad­ ministration, together with federal or federal-linked companies. Currently, the BQA is in discussion with other federal institutions such as PTB or BAM. This federal quantum alliance is thus a useful addition to the various ‘quantum alliances’ in Germany that have been shown to date, since it explicitly address­ es companies and authorities owned by the Federal Government and can multiply the insights gained in the Qu-Gov project.

As a link between the military and industry, BWI operates and develops the IT used within the German armed forces, carries out digital transformation projects and tests and implements innovative use cases. In the latter case in particular, BWI focuses on the early and application-oriented use of novel technologies. In this respect, BWI clearly distinguishes itself from research in its portfolio of services: BWI primarily builds on research results and enables their subsequent imple­ mentation in practice. To this end the ‘Competence Centre Quantum Enabled Technologies’ was founded within the Innovation & Technology division of BWI. Their stated aim is to raise awareness of quantum technologies in the BWI and Bundeswehr environ­ ment. Market and technology screenings, knowledge transfer from consulting projects and individual trials are all used to draw up specific recommendations for action for BWI’s service portfolio. Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft e. V. [German Research Foundation] (DFG) The DFG’s primary task is to promote cutting-edge, knowledge-driven research. The DFG is particularly active in those areas where research itself deter­ mines the topics, following the dynamics of scientific knowledge processes. Eligible individuals, groups or institutions can therefore submit funding proposals to the DFG at any time and on any topic. The increas­"
1,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,42,1,"ing demand for both individual funding and coordi­ nated programmes, and the associated increase in the volume of awards in the field of quantum technology, show that the DFG’s instruments are addressing needs across the entire spectrum of funding. In 2021 a total of 149 projects carrying an annual funding amount of EUR 58.6 million directly related to the research field of ‘quantum technology’ were be­ ing funded at the time. Of this, EUR 40.4 million was awarded to Clusters of Excellence.77 This corresponds to an increase of about 11% within three years. Through coordinated programmes (Collaborative Research Centres, Research Training Groups, Clusters of Excellence), individual research areas are often strongly influenced by quantum technology, while the entire consortium tends to pursue fundamental research in natural sciences and engineering. Over the course of its formative and strategic trading in the European Research Area, the DFG participates in the ERA-Net QuantERA. The EU-funded association of 39 research funding organisations drawn from 31 countries supports research on quantum technologies, specifically through calls for transnational projects. In the last call for proposals, the DFG was responsible for funding participation from Germany in fundamental science-­ oriented projects. The 19 projects partly funded by the DFG will start in 2022. The next call for proposals, in which the DFG plans to participate, will take place in 2023. Within the framework of two major research in­ strumentation initiatives for research into quantum technology, which were launched in 2021, the DFG is providing support to eight universities through a total of approximately EUR 17.7 million. The aim of largescale equipment initiatives is to make the latest tech­ nology available for research.

With the ICON-­ Consolidated development line, the DWD and its partners from the ICON consortium (Max Planck Institut für Meteorology [MPI-M], German Climate Computing Center [DKRZ], Karlsruhe Institute of Technologe [KIT)] are also preparing the ICON weather and climate model for future HPC architectures. When the technology is sufficiently mature, this will also be completed for those architectures based on quantum computing. The expected extreme increase in computing power will allow even more accurate simulations of atmospheric processes to take place at a hitherto unprecedented resolution, while at the same time any uncertainties will be better qualified.

For this purpose, 80% of the funds flow into those companies that cover their full costs and can even achieve a profit margin. This is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises or start-ups who have less financial power. The development of quantum computers for DLR’s research fields is therefore building up a parallel industrial ecosystem. At the same time the results (intellectual property) and co-determination rights in this potentially sensitive area of technology are to be secured for DLR, although the companies executing the work are to be given the freedom to act through a grant-back.

The MPG has tightened up its strategy with regard to QST; extensive activities have been launched, both internally and externally, two of which are briefly explained below: Max Planck Quantum Alliance (MPQA) An important component of a sustainable long-term strategy for the MPG in the area of QST is the es­ tablishment of an internationally visible umbrella organisation that unites the various activities (new and existing) within the MPG and provides a platform for the implementation of further measures. This MPQA initiative aims to increase the global visibility of the MPG in QST, to strengthen the collaboration within the MPG between the participating depart­ ments in the field of QST, and to increase competi­ tiveness in attracting top talent who are very much in demand internationally. As some of the QST research topics are located between the core areas of different institutes (especially with regard to scientific concepts and/or the required technological infrastructures), the interdisciplinarity of QST remains an ongoing challenge.

PTB enables QT components already established at PTB (and other research institutions) to be developed further to meet the requirements of this practical application. 2. Calibrations and services. An important prerequisite for commercial use is reliable and comparable QT components and the assurance and certification of specifications for quality assurance through cali­ bration and characterisation. With these original services provided by PTB in its role as an independ­ ent, national metrology institute, PTB creates an important, resilient basis for QT to enter the market. 3. User platforms in the QTZ. The user platforms pro­ vide robust and user-friendly measuring stations in key areas of QT and are to be used by external partners, supported by the staff and infrastructure at PTB. The aim here is to enable partners to gain their own experience in QT without having to build the infrastructure themselves, something that typ­ ically requires very high levels of investment and lead times, especially in QT. A lack of contact and experience in relation to the techniques used and their time-consuming set-up represent a further challenge, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Particularly in a potentially very dynamic and disruptive field such as QT, this can be a major disadvantage that is difficult to remedy in terms of competitiveness, and is therefore an issue that QTZ is intended to help resolve. 4. Hands-on training, quantum education and support for start-ups. The implementation of QT in the market requires well-trained staff, for which there are currently not enough training opportunities. Already existing connections at PTB with important players from industry provide an excellent starting point for training a ‘quantum work force’ of this kind promptly and as required, making use of user platforms that are particularly suited to this pur­ pose. Another option for knowledge transfer is the encouragement and promotion of business start-ups."

Recent initiatives to strengthen the in­ dustry have emerged from this evolving QT ecosystem: ∙Together with QVLS partners, PTB operates a QT high-tech incubator. Through funding from the state of Lower Saxony, 14 teams (start-ups and young companies) are currently being granted incentive funding, including the use of technical infrastructure and further support. ∙The recently selected future cluster QVLS-iLabs (ilabs.qvls.de, expected to start in March 2023) complements the high-tech incubator through cooperation with established industry figures. PTB coordinates the BMBF-funded Quantum Commu­ nication Germany umbrella project in close cooper­ ation with the BSI. The central goal of this project is to fuel the coherent development of quantum communication, to act as a platform for all relevant partners from Germany and thereby to ensure a strong role for Germany and Europe in terms of commercialisation. This allows synergies to be leveraged, duplications to be avoided and therefore ensures the optimal use of resources from research and industry, significantly strengthening compet­ itive positioning in the international environment and securing technological sovereignty in the long term. DIN is directly involved in the project through a subcontract. In addition to the umbrel­ la project, the metrology required for industrial implementation is also being developed from the outset in various current research programmes, for example, on quantum computer demonstrators. These activities are open to technology and span diverse architectures. For the industrial development of QT participation in standardisation is an important factor – standards that have been set outside Europe must not limit the compatibility of QT components developed in Europe. It is in the interest of Germany holding a strong posi­ tion that they collaborate in standardisation. PTB is involved in various standardisation activities, for ex­ ample, PTB has co-chaired the Focus Group on Stand­ ardisation of CEN-CENELEC since 2019, while DIN"

PTB is also working with various partners to develop further training courses for industry. The goal here is to support the coherent and well-coordinated devel­ opment of offers in Germany, with the intention of avoiding duplication and providing effective and easy access for interested parties from industry, moving beyond thematic or regional interests.

2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,2,1,"National Quantum Strategy Ministerial Foreword The first generation of quantum technologies created many innovations that we now take for granted in modern society, from the MRI machine to mobile devices. Yet there are lesser known but equally powerful inventions emerging from UK labs that could change our world beyond recognition. These inventions will improve the lives of everyone in the UK, from improving healthcare and speeding up drug discovery, to boosting economic growth and security and providing jobs. They will also help us tackle climate change, build a sustainable future for our children, and help the UK to respond to growing global volatility, as set out in the government’s Integrated Review Refresh. Quantum rewrites the rules of classical physics, and in doing so allows us to do things previously thought impossible. Take, for example, exquisitely sensitive brain scanners that will reveal new insights into epilepsy or dementia, or sensors that let us see what lies beneath the ground from the surface. These are already being used in real-world settings today. In 2023, the government created the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) to deliver our mission to be the most innovative economy in the world and a science and technology superpower. Quantum technologies are at the core of this mission, not only as one of our five priority technologies of tomorrow – quantum, AI, engineering biology, semiconductors, future telecoms – but also as a technology that could release the full potential of every other on that list. The UK is already a global leader in quantum technologies. In 2014 we set up the National Quantum Technologies Programme, the first of its kind in the world, to support excellent research and begin to take technologies out of the research environment. The UK’s highly collaborative quantum community reflects that foresight from nearly ten years ago. The UK has world-leading strengths in quantum, including our deep research talent, the knowledge built up across the different quantum technologies, our rapidly growing quantum sector, and our strengths throughout quantum and related supply chains. We are determined to build on these strengths with vision and long-term funding certainty. This national strategy sets out our new ten-year ambitious commitment to quantum technologies in the UK. We firmly believe that Britain should lead the world in this physical science and deliver opportunities and jobs in hardware, engineering and advanced manufacturing as well as in software and applications across the economy. As part of our new department’s ethos of taking immediate action backed up by strong long-term planning we are more than doubling our investment into quantum by investing £2.5 billion in quantum over the next ten years, with the aim of attracting significant additional private investment on top of that."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,3,1,"National Quantum Strategy This ten-year plan will fund new frontiers of quantum research, support and develop our growing quantum sector, prepare our wider economy for the quantum revolution and ensure that the UK leads internationally in the regulation and ethical use of quantum technologies. We will make the UK the home for cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, the best place in the world to start and grow a quantum business, a leading voice in the international quantum and tech community, and a magnet for international quantum talent. We have worked hand in hand with the UK quantum community to bring this national strategy to fruition; I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this process. The hard work starts now to deliver on its goals together. The Rt Hon Michelle Donelan MP Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,4,1,"Executive Summary Over the next ten years, quantum technologies will revolutionise many aspects of life in the UK and bring enormous benefits to the UK economy, society and the way we can protect our planet. The UK has a world-leading position and quantum is one of the top priorities for the government, as set out in the Integrated Review Refresh. This strategy sets out our plan for the next ten years, building on the successes to date, to realise the incredible potential of these technologies for the UK. Quantum technologies take advantage of phenomena at the atomic scale to find new ways to manipulate information. These technologies will one day make it possible to solve complex problems that are currently impossible to solve with even the most powerful high-performance classical computer and will allow us to reach entirely new frontiers in sensing, timing, imaging and communications. Quantum technologies already offer possible solutions to some of our greatest societal challenges and, perhaps most excitingly, offer future capabilities that are yet to be explored. They will improve lives, drive economic growth and create jobs, and make us more secure. • The exponential increase in computing power from quantum computers could revolutionise our healthcare system - from dramatically improved drug discovery techniques to providing personalised treatment to an individual based on genetic and environmental factors -, help to manage and make best use of our national energy infrastructure, and even accelerate the path to autonomy and entirely new AI applications. It could deliver on our sustainability goals by improving solar panels and batteries as well as cutting the energy demands of data centres. Over the next three to five years, quantum computing could deliver $5-10 billion of benefits across the world; and this rises to $450-$850 billion in the next fifteen to thirty years.1 • Quantum sensing and imaging can provide unprecedented insight about what lies beneath the ground - saving billions in environmental monitoring and on large-scale construction projects -, open new ways to diagnose and treat disease and monitor and reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are invisible to the human eye. Quantum sensing could generate at least $5 billion in revenue by 2030.2 • Quantum clocks and communication could help us develop new navigation and timing capabilities without the need for a satellite link, providing even 1 Boston Consulting Group July 2021 “What Happens When ‘If’ Turns to ‘When’ in Quantum Computing? 2 McKinsey & Company, December 2021"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,5,1,"greater resilience for railways, telecommunications and emergency services - as well as helping to secure the global communications network against cybercrime. Quantum communications could account for an estimated $8 billion in revenue by 2030.3 Those countries that are amongst the first to develop quantum technologies, and use them widely across the economy, will have vast advantages in terms of productivity, economic growth, health, sustainability, and national security and resilience, not least because of the anticipated ability of quantum computers to undermine cryptography used to secure the internet. This means that quantum is a priority technology for the government, and one that will remain critically important for our economic growth, economic security, national security and defence. We are in a global race to develop and commercialise these capabilities. The UK was an early mover, but other countries are accelerating their own efforts. Investing in quantum now, building on the strengths that we have already established, will ensure that we deliver on quantum technologies for the UK. Building on strong foundations We have already made great progress in the UK, with a £1 billion investment in research and development from 2014.4 Over its ten-year lifetime, this programme has built leading capabilities in quantum computing, sensors and timing, imaging and communications, and helped to build their path to market. As a result, the UK has considerable strengths and opportunities in quantum: • We have invested in quantum skills, funding postgraduate research and fellowships, and have some of the world’s leading quantum experts. Our talent is a key draw to locate a quantum business in the UK. • We have a rapidly growing quantum sector - we rank second in the world to the US for the number of quantum companies and second in attracting private investment, leading the competition in Europe.5 • The UK’s developing quantum sector has a broad range of capabilities, with companies across the range of quantum technologies – computing, communications, sensing, imaging, and timing. We are also acknowledged as world-leading in developing quantum computing software for error correction and applications. • We have industrial strengths in the supply chain, in areas such as photonics, electronics and cryogenics, which are essential to quantum technologies.

2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,6,1,"have world leading clusters, such as the compound semiconductor cluster in South Wales, and a long-established photonics cluster in Scotland. • The extent of collaboration within the quantum community in the UK is a particular and rare strength. The government has funded 139 projects involving 141 quantum organisations through the Innovate UK Commercialising Quantum Challenge alone.6 The interplay between the different elements of the community in the UK – from hardware, to software, to components and enablers – is particularly strong. • Our testing and assurance capabilities, through the National Physical Laboratory, are amongst the best in the world and a key enabler for the sector. • We also have key user sector strengths, for example, in space, finance, aerospace, defence and life sciences, which provide a strong domestic market for quantum technologies. • We are also strong in other technologies, such as artificial intelligence, high performance computing, space, telecoms, and engineering biology, which when integrated with quantum technologies could boost capabilities and impact. Government investments to date through the National Quantum Technologies Programme have created a unique and diverse pool of talent, capabilities and knowhow within our quantum sector. However, given the pace of change globally and the challenge of bringing quantum into widespread use, it is the right time to set out a clear ambition and funding certainty for the next ten years to capitalise on this leading position and to accelerate the path to commercialisation. This strategy sets out a bold and ambitious approach to supporting quantum technologies in the UK across the broad spectrum of quantum computing, sensing, timing, imaging and communications. We will develop UK strengths across different hardware platforms, software and components, and reinforce our capabilities throughout the supply chains. Although international collaboration is an essential part of our approach, it is not in the UK’s interests to rely purely on others for access to these critical technologies. We will also invest in and strengthen the key ecosystem enablers, such as skills, infrastructure, regulation and standards. We will monitor the development of these technologies, both in the UK and in other countries, and the development of the market, to ensure we can flex our approach to deliver the best possible outcome for the UK. 6 UK Quantum Technologies Challenge, The Directory, UKRI"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,7,1,"A new ten-year vision, plan and commitment Our vision is for the UK to be a leading quantum-enabled economy by 2033, with a world leading sector, and where quantum technologies are an integral part of the UK’s future digital infrastructure and advanced manufacturing base, driving growth and helping to build a thriving and resilient economy and society. To achieve this, we will commit £2.5 billion to developing quantum technologies in the UK over the ten years from 2024 – more than doubling current public investment - which will aim to generate an additional £1 billion of private investment into the programme. This programme will: • Ensure the UK is home to world-leading quantum science and engineering, growing UK knowledge and skills • Support business, making the UK the go-to place for quantum businesses and an integral part of the global supply chain, as well as a preferred location for investors and global talent • Drive the adoption and use of quantum technologies in the UK to deliver benefits for the economy and society, as well as our national security • Create a national and international regulatory framework that supports innovation and the ethical use of quantum technologies, and protects UK capabilities and national security This strategy sets out a ten-year vision, plan and priority actions. As quantum technologies develop, the UK will need to make some key strategic decisions about where to focus efforts to realise the benefits from these technologies. At this early stage it is important to continue to build the science, grow the vibrant ecosystem, explore a range of technology platforms and parts of the supply chain where the UK has world leading strengths, in addition to focussing on software and use case exploration. But it’s also important to be more targeted where and when we can, working with industry to accelerate development within high value applications as they emerge to grow a world class quantum sector and deliver benefits for the economy and society. We will therefore develop our priority actions over time within the wider programme based on progress and wider trends, in full consultation with the UK quantum community. We will report regularly to the National Science and Technology Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, and publish an annual report on progress. 10"

2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,12,1,"Introduction: Quantum Technologies in the UK What are quantum technologies? Many technologies that are part of our everyday life are based on our knowledge of quantum mechanics, from the lasers that are used in smartphones or for modern telecommunications, to superconducting devices which have revolutionised medical imaging. Today, second-generation quantum technologies make the realisation of entirely new advances possible, based on the ability to generate, detect and control quantum states. We are on the cusp of a new wave of innovation that will offer a step change in performance from an unprecedented increase in compute power, to exquisitely precise sensors, and enhanced communications. The advantages that these enabling quantum technologies will offer, alongside AI, high performance computing (HPC), and a broader suite of technologies, will transform how we interact with the world. Such technologies hold the potential to increase resilience, national security, productivity and competitiveness across many critical sectors including health, cyber security and defence and help tackle some of the biggest challenges that we face. Quantum technologies also pose potential national security challenges, not least the expectation that quantum computers will be capable of undermining the cryptography used to secure internet data. The physical properties of nature at the atomic or subatomic level, and quantum systems, are both incredibly susceptible to outside interference (which creates exquisitely sensitive sensors or precise clocks) and exhibit novel properties (like the ability to link particles (entanglement), or for them to exist in multiple states (superposition)) which means they offer novel ways of storing, processing and sending information. Quantum technologies use these quantum effects to, for example, perform computation, create images of objects, sense the size, shape or movement of an object, or provide a timing signal. The UK has an exceptional history in modern quantum physics, from the seminal theoretical work of Artur Ekert in the early 1990s that showed that encrypted keys can be secured by quantum systems, to the cutting-edge technologies now being developed in our research organisations and businesses. 15"

Regional centres of excellence exist up and down the country, from the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) in Harwell, to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Teddington, the Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics in Glasgow, to our four research hubs led by the Universities of York, Birmingham, Glasgow, and Oxford. These centres and their communities have built wide-ranging networks, bringing together experts from universities, national laboratories, and industry partners to collaborate on quantum science and technologies. This ecosystem is widely admired and emulated by other countries as it has built a vibrant collaborative enterprise, connecting great research to translation and commercialisation. The National Hubs in quantum science and technologies have claimed many world firsts since the programme began, such as the first industrial demonstrations of a quantum gravimeter (capable of sensing underground objects), the first chip-to-chip Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) encrypted transmission, and achieving world record performance in ion trap quantum computing. The UK is in the top five in a range of metrics for global academic excellence.11 Quantum Sensors and Timing Despite our increasing ability to detect and monitor things that exist on land, sea or in space, we still often resort to digging or drilling holes to find objects such as forgotten pipes and cabling or to locate and measure sinkholes and mine workings. Researchers from the EPSRC-supported UK National Quantum Hub in Sensors and Timing and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) have teamed up with specialist environmental engineering company, RSK and Teledyne e2V to develop a new ground mapping technology, a ‘quantum gravity gradiometer’. The device works by detecting variations in microgravity using the principles of quantum physics. This was tested outside the lab for the first time in 2022, successfully detecting a hidden underground object. The technology offers potentially faster, cheaper, and more reliable capabilities than current systems, with the opportunity to reduce the time needed for surveys, for example, from a month to a few days. The programme has led to the successful transfer of knowledge and technology into many UK companies; generating and supporting around 50 quantum technology start-ups; nurturing a highly skilled quantum workforce, including over 470 PhD candidates and many fellowships; attracting more venture capital investment per capita into quantum technology than any other country.12 11 DSIT internal analysis using Elsevier BV Subscription Agreement BEIS 2022.

2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,16,1,"New quantum devices that have been developed in the UK across computing, communications, sensing and timing are now being trialled globally, from wearable brain scanners that will improve our understanding of neurological disorders, to miniaturised atomic clocks that will end dependence on satellites for timing which is critical for everything from healthcare to navigation and financial services. Recent developments in the sector show that the UK is an innovative centre for the commercialisation and deployment of quantum technologies. These include the launch of the first commercial trial of a quantum secured communication service in London, the integration of quantum gas cameras into monitoring systems in the oil and gas industry, and the release of a platform agnostic quantum computing operating system. The UK is now home to the largest number of quantum start-ups in Europe.13 It attracts more capital investment than any other country in Europe.14 Businesses supported by the UK Commercialising Quantum Challenge have raised over £425m in private sector financing since the programme began.15 Over 120 UK businesses partner with the UK national research hubs in quantum technologies16 and, in recognition of this connected community, a number of international quantum companies have chosen to locate operations in the UK. We also have leading businesses across the supply chain (including lasers, cryogenic systems, high vacuum equipment, electronic control systems and photon detectors) who are winning contracts in the UK and exporting to the quantum community in global markets. More broadly, the UK is a major pull for global talent, investment and collaboration due to our global reputation for R&D excellence, an innovative and transparent regulatory environment, world-class intellectual property and competitive tax regimes, as well as dedicated visa schemes for innovative companies. The UK is also home to high R&D investment sectors that are essential in the development of emerging technologies, such as advanced manufacturing, automotive, aerospace and finance. Challenges As demonstrated above, the potential applications of quantum technologies are vast. This is both an opportunity and a challenge, with the sheer range of possible uses meaning it often takes time and considerable expertise for prospective users to understand the potential of the technology and focus on the most impactful application. Other challenges specific to quantum technologies include: • The technology is still emerging. For quantum computing, which is further from the market than other applications, there is still uncertainty around which technical approach 13 McKinsey & Company (September 2021), The Quantum Technology Monitor 14 DSIT internal analysis using Quantum Insider data, February 2023.

2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,17,1,"will prove to be the most effective to solving the scientific and engineering challenge. It is also important to understand the interplay between quantum hardware and software, as well as supply chains specific to each technical approach, in order to build a strong UK capability. In other areas, such as sensing and timing, although a step change in performance can be demonstrated in a lab, it is not always clear when quantum will be the preferred solution in real-world settings. • We are still in the early days of commercialising quantum, with most quantum technologies in the research, development or early demonstration phase. Developing quantum products and services can be a long and challenging process, with the need for sustained investment and support before profits can be made. • The quantum sector must compete with more established sectors to access packaging and fabrication capabilities, challenging when companies are having to undertake exploratory design cycles in small batches. As with other deep tech sectors, the capital requirement for research, development and deployment of products is considerable. This challenge is likely to increase in the coming years as products get closer to market and companies require more access to expensive infrastructure and commercial scale packaging and fabrication facilities. • Demand for quantum skills outstrips supply, despite sustained investment in the UK. Competition for skills is increasing, with recent analysis showing that globally quantum job adverts outstrip qualified talent by as much as three to one17, and salaries for top quantum professionals are more than double the UK average in the US.18 • Global investment and competition are increasing at a rapid pace and scale. The UK is working within a changing geopolitical context with other governments ramping up investment into their national research programmes - with funding of at least $15 billion in China, and $7.2 billion in the European Union19, with the US now spending around $820 million a year,20 and Japan recently doubling its annual expenditure to around $590 million in 2022.21 • Large corporations headquartered overseas have also established significant quantum programmes. This increase in activity means that UK companies face tougher competition for talent and have to be aware of the potential risks associated with technology transfer and trade restrictions."

2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,18,1,"Our Approach The UK is in a strong position to play a world-leading role in quantum technologies, if we can overcome the challenges outlined above (many of which are shared by other nations). We have strategic choices about the approach we take across the different quantum technologies: For quantum computing, our ambition is for the UK to support the development of and access to state-of-the-art and eventually fully scalable machines in order to explore beneficial applications for the economy and society and undertake research. At the same time this will give the UK quantum sector the best opportunity to capture a significant share of the global market creating jobs and delivering value to the UK economy. This means we must continue to develop UK strengths in quantum computing hardware, software and throughout the supply chain, which involves meeting significant engineering challenges. Given the early stage of the technological development, and the fact that there are numerous platforms that could provide the path to developing a fully scalable machine, we will take a broad and ambitious approach to supporting quantum computing in the UK across the development of different hardware platforms, software, components, and all relevant supply chains. Although international collaboration will be an important part of our approach, it is not in the UK’s interests to sit back and rely purely on others for access to quantum computing hardware, so we will continue to develop UK strengths across the development of different hardware platforms, as well as software. We will monitor the development of these technologies, both in the UK and in other countries, and the development of the market to ensure that we can flex our approach to deliver the best possible outcome for the UK. For quantum sensing, timing and imaging, our ambition is to develop the technology so that the UK is in a strong position to play an important role globally in the next generation of sensors and position, navigation and timing (PNT) capabilities, working with international partners. For quantum communications, our ambition is to realise both the potential of these technologies for secure communications where clear benefits can be demonstrated, as well as the opportunities they present for networking to help scale quantum computers, sharing information and addressing data storage challenges. Collaborating with international partners is a key element of this approach. As quantum technologies develop and use cases are fully demonstrated, the UK will need to make key strategic decisions about where to focus efforts to realise the benefits from these technologies. At this early stage it is important to continue to build the science, grow the vibrant ecosystem, explore a range of technology platforms and parts of the supply chain where the UK has world leading strengths, in addition to focussing on software and use case exploration. But it is also important to be more targeted where and when we can, working with industry to accelerate development within high value applications as they emerge to grow a world-class quantum sector and deliver benefits for the economy and society. We will therefore develop government actions over time within the wider programme based on progress and wider trends, in full consultation with the UK quantum community. We will report"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,19,1,"regularly to the National Science and Technology Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, and publish an annual report on progress. This strategy sets out how we will put this approach into practice through domestic and international policy to achieve our vision and objectives for quantum technologies in the UK. Ten-year vision and goals Over the next ten years, we will build on our success to date by taking advantage of our world leading science and capabilities and supporting the continued growth of the UK’s quantum sector to realise the significant potential of quantum technologies for the economy. Our ten-year vision is for the UK to be a world leading quantum-enabled economy, building on scientific excellence and creating a thriving quantum sector to ensure that quantum technologies are an integral part of the UK’s digital infrastructure and advanced manufacturing base, driving growth and helping to build a strong and resilient economy and society. To realise this vision we will set four goals: • Ensure the UK is home to world-leading quantum science and engineering, growing UK knowledge and skills • Support business, making the UK the go-to place for quantum businesses and an integral part of the global supply chain, as well as a preferred location for investors and global talent • Drive the use of quantum technologies in the UK to deliver benefits for the economy, for society and for our national security • Create a national and international regulatory framework that supports innovation and the ethical use of quantum technologies, and protects UK capabilities and national security The government has published a Science and Technology Framework to build the UK into a Science and Technology Superpower, to help deliver stronger growth, better jobs, and bold discoveries to tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow. The Science and Technology Framework has been designed in consultation with experts and practitioners across industry, academia and government to address the key challenges in delivering the UK’s Science and Technology Superpower ambitions. It represents commitment to a whole-of-government plan – introducing a truly systems approach to ensure policy, delivery, funding and messaging levers across traditional siloes are aligned and channelled to secure strategic advantage in S&T as a top UK priority. It includes boosting investment in research and development, building on the UK’s already enviable talent and skills base, investing in research and innovation infrastructure, ensuring we regulate in a way that supports innovation and growing technology sectors."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,20,1,"The Framework also sets out a more systematic way of identifying UK priority technologies, with the first five including quantum technologies (as well as AI, engineering biology, semiconductors, and future telecoms). As such, quantum technologies will benefit from the wider use of government levers set out in the Framework. This National Quantum Strategy therefore focuses on the quantum specific activities that the government or others need to undertake, in addition to wider government initiatives, to support the growth of the sector. The following chapters set out how we will achieve each of our four goals."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,21,1,"Goal 1: World-leading research and skills We will ensure the UK is home to world-leading quantum science and engineering, growing UK knowledge and skills Research and Development The UK is the home to excellent science and innovation, and nowhere is this more true than in quantum technologies, where we already have an established programme of public and private R&D with over £1 billion of investment over the period 2014-2024. The next phase of quantum R&D in the UK will be even greater in terms of ambition, scale and impact. It will focus on securing and building on our existing strengths, as well as exploring new areas of scientific endeavour. It will provide greater support to the work of our researchers and businesses to translate, demonstrate and commercialise quantum research, driving development in key areas with commercial, societal or security value. This will ensure that the UK is a global centre of excellence for the long term. We will therefore establish a new and ambitious ten-year £2.5 billion quantum research and innovation programme from 2024-2034. The future programme will be delivered in two 5-year phases, to be developed in full consultation with our partners across Government, most notably UKRI, independent expert advice and with industry. The core elements of the first 5-year phase will include: • A new portfolio of applications-focussed Quantum Technology Research Hubs and Centres. These will build on the success that the existing hubs have had in building a vibrant quantum research and innovation ecosystem. The future hubs will draw together activities around a specific application area or theme, delivering strength and depth in quantum technologies and catalysing future growth and national capability. They will ensure the UK is a global centre of excellence in cutting edge quantum science and technologies for the long term. These new Research Hubs or Centres will be formed from consortia of academic experts in quantum technologies and relevant disciplines, with additional collaborating partners from industry, government, or the third sector. The hubs will also build the mechanisms needed to support the integration of these emerging technologies into wider systems, led by end users. • Mission-focussed programmes: specific outcome-focussed innovation programmes to drive development towards a set societal and economic benefit. • Industry-led innovation programmes: project-based programmes encouraging greater R&D activity and further investment by industry in areas that address existing"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,22,1,"challenges to commercialisation. The programme might include feasibility projects to explore new opportunities for the commercialisation of quantum technologies; or collaborative innovation projects to tackle the challenges to translating and commercialising quantum. • Accelerator programmes: that will grow specific technology sectors and companies and accelerate the path to commercial and technological maturity, building on key strengths in the current programme and UK landscape and promoting sovereign capability and market leadership in areas with significant market opportunity. These programmes will focus on bridging the gap between early growth and market readiness by enabling demonstration in real-world settings with users and integrators. • Training and talent programmes: to invest in postgraduate skills, technical and engineering professionals, and apprenticeships to deliver the quantum researchers, innovators, and practitioners the UK needs. • International collaboration programmes: building on the strengths of the existing programme and broadening international R&D collaborations with our close partners for mutual benefit. • Infrastructure investments: to meet the needs of the evolving field and sector, including continued funding for core operational activities of national facilities such as the National Quantum Computing Centre and National Physical Laboratory. • Underpinning fundamental research: continuing to enable response-mode research through existing EPSRC and STFC programmes to advance the science, and enable the utilisation of quantum as a tool for wider research. We recognise the need to make a smooth transition from the current R&D programme to the new ten-year programme. The current phase of the programme will continue to deliver world leading research through all existing core elements until 2024. Over the next year we will consult widely on the specifics of the future programme and will also make additional investments within the existing programme to support the transition. These additional investments include: • £100 million to continue to develop the existing application areas of computing, communications, sensing, imaging and timing through new quantum hub activities • £70 million in the development of two short-term quantum missions focussed on achieving key technological milestones around quantum computing and PNT. This approach over the next three years will act as a pilot for longer-term missions that will be delivered over the next decade to galvanise technology development and help address some of society’s most pressing challenges. • £25 million for increased investment in quantum fellowships and doctoral training, over and above the existing Centres for Doctoral Training and Fellowships schemes. • £15 million to boost government procurement of quantum technologies for public use. • £20 million for acceleration activities, working with the sector on collaborative R&D in quantum networking."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,23,1,• £20 million additional funding for increased activities through the National Quantum Computing Centre. The £70m quantum missions announced as part of the government’s £250m investment in technology missions aim to:
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,23,2,"1. Accelerate quantum technologies for resilient capabilities in Position Navigation & Timing (PNT), leading to the demonstration of mature proof-of-principle prototypes by 2025 in environments where traditional satellites cannot reach, creating resilience in military and civil contexts."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,23,3,"2. Developing quantum computing test-beds – demonstrating the advantage of a quantum computer over a classical one through applications to underpin the growth of a UK quantum computing sector capable of delivering quantum advantage in 2025. For this investment of £2.5 billion we are expecting the private sector to commit to invest £1 billion into the programme over its lifetime. Up to now, we have achieved evenly matched industry funding from our innovation programmes. This takes account of direct contributions to programme activities only; the overall benefits and investment into the sector resulting from the programme will be much greater. Skills Access to the right skills and talent is essential for excellence in research, technology development and commercialisation. Building a diverse and thriving workforce that can drive the growing quantum industry will be vital to unlocking economic and societal benefits in the future. This requires highly skilled people – ensuring the UK has the researchers, engineers, innovators, and practitioners it needs to have a quantum-ready workforce. It means postgraduate training, the development of technical professionals and apprenticeships, and attraction and retention of world leading experts in the field. The quantum sector is small but rapidly evolving, with an expectation that skills needs will change over time. The call for evidence responses told us we are facing challenges associated with the small global talent pool for quantum-specific talent. A recent survey found that the top challenge for businesses in preparing for quantum computing was being able to access the right skills and talent.22 Talent shortages also exist within the domestic sector itself according to UK-based companies. The picture is similar internationally, with the US National Science and Technology Council finding that there is a skills shortage at all levels already, alongside a projected increase in demand in the future.23 Further to this, the wider STEM workforce that acts as a pipeline for future talent has been found to suffer from some persistent skill shortages and be less diverse 22 Ernst & Young, Quantum Readiness Survey 2022 23 US National Science and Technology Council, QIST Workforce Development National Strategic Plan, February 2022"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,24,1,"than the wider workforce. Women make up just over a quarter of the STEM workforce,24 making it challenging to achieve a diverse future workforce that is representative of society. People and know-how are driving the early development of the emerging sector. We have provided strong support for growing the highly-specialised skills needed in the quantum sector since 2014. We have trained more than 470 doctoral students,25 including through the EPSRC’s Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs), the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and the National Physical Laboratory. We have also funded over 30 fellowships to support the brightest and the best to undertake their research in the UK, recognising the importance of academic freedom to do great things.26 Fellowships Quantum fellowships have been instrumental in nurturing early talent, providing access to specialist support and equipment, and allowing individuals to grow their international networks. The success of these awards can be seen through the world class research and spinouts that have resulted from current and former fellows. These include: Joint EPSRC and NQCC scheme to support fellows to build their careers and deliver cutting-edge research in the UK The EPSRC Open Fellowship supporting talented researchers across EPSRC’s portfolio The UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship designed to develop the next generation of worldclass researchers across universities, businesses and other R&D environments STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellowships enabling early career researchers to establish a research programme The UK has benefitted from attracting quantum talent from around the world. The UK’s pointsbased immigration system provides attractive routes for highly skilled people to move to the UK, including the high potential individual visa, scale-up visa, innovator visa, and the global talent visa. However, the visa system can sometimes act as a barrier to attracting highly talented individuals. We will work with partners across government to ensure that the immigration system allows companies and universities to attract the very top talent, who are in high demand in multiple countries. 24 Analysis by WISE Campaign, December 2021 25 UK National Quantum Technologies Programme (NQTP).

2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,25,1,"Visa routes The government is updating the routes that talented individuals in the field of quantum can use to come to the UK and continue their careers. We will ensure that the quantum sector is able to make full use of this opportunity. Announced in the UK Innovation Strategy, these include: The High Potential Individual Route make it as simple as possible for internationally mobile researchers who demonstrate high potential to come to the UK, based on graduation from an eligible top global university A scale-up route, which allows talented individuals with an offer from a qualifying scale-up to come to the UK And a revitalised Innovator route, which allows talented innovators and entrepreneurs to start and run a business in the UK that is either venture backed or innovative. This route is being refreshed to simplify and streamline its business eligibility criteria and build flexibility The Global Talent visa route is open to those who are leaders or potential leaders in science and technology. Applicants must be endorsed by one of six endorsing bodies for the route, which include the Royal Society and UKRI, or have been awarded a prestigious prize. Applicants may qualify for endorsement if they have an eligible job offer, an individual fellowship or a research grant approved by UKRI. Building a quantum-literate workforce As the sector scales, there will be a need for more emphasis on routes into the sector beyond doctoral training, as well as to build the pipeline from schools upwards. Professionalisation of quantum engineering skills will help talent to transition from adjacent sectors. To this end we will engage with UK professional bodies including the Institution of Engineering & Technology (IET) and the Institute of Physics (IoP) to develop awareness, skills and recognition of continuing professional development and careers in support of the quantum sector. Increasing quantum literacy and cross-fertilisation with domain expertise in the economy overall, particularly in key end-user sectors, is essential to growing the sector in the UK. We recognise the need for more skilled technicians in the UK, a problem that is not unique to the quantum sector. These are the people who undertake skilled practical work with scientific or other equipment to enable the integration of quantum technologies into wider systems, often undertaking vocational or on the job training. The IoP found that over 50% of physics-related jobs do not require a degree27, indicating the potential scale of the role of vocational training. There are already successful initiatives to meet the technician need, such as the NPL 27 IoP, Unlocking the potential of physics skills in the UK and Ireland"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,26,1,"Apprenticeship scheme which has hosted over 100 apprentices since 2013, including rotations in the quantum technology department. We will broaden activities to meet this growing need nationwide, aligning with wider government objectives to strengthen technical training in the UK. The UK Science and Technology Framework will be seeking to address the broader STEM skills gap through a dedicated Talent and Skills strand. This will focus on creating an agile and responsive skills system; recruiting and retaining STEM teachers; expanding opportunities for participation in STEM and ensuring that a more diverse range of people participate in STEM opportunities; giving people the opportunity to train, retrain and upskill throughout their lives; and establishing competitive advantage in attracting international talent to the UK. The Department for Education is developing a Skills Dashboard in 2023 to better understand the supply and demand of science and technology skills for priority technologies, including quantum technologies. To boost quantum skills in the UK we will: • More than double the number of Centres for Doctoral Training focused on Quantum Technologies. This will contribute to training over 1,000 PhD students in quantum or a directly supporting field over the next ten years. • Ensure the UK can continue to attract, develop and retain world leading experts by investing in tailored packages, such as fellowships for the brightest researchers. • We will start with an investment of £25 million over the next two years to increase quantum-related fellowships and doctoral training. We will continue to increase this over the new ten-year programme. • Establish the Quantum Skills Taskforce, bringing together industry, academia, and professional societies with the relevant government agencies to ensure that the quantum skills system is guided by the needs of our most promising companies. We will work further with these groups to develop and publish a skills action plan within the next 12 months. • Develop a range of measures to inspire the next generation of quantum scientists, engineers, and technicians. We will fund an expansion of STEM Learning’s Quantum Ambassador schools outreach programme, launch a further series of domestic and international summer schools and research exchanges, and develop both a quantum industry placement scheme and a quantum apprenticeships programme. • Support global quantum talent moving to the UK through the enhanced visa routes for highly-skilled individuals. • Deliver a quantum priority stream in the UK Global Talent Network. The network, operating in the United States and India, will proactively attract and support the best internationally mobile science and technology talent to come to the UK. It will work hand in hand with the National Quantum Technologies Programme, which will continue to provide access to funding, equipment, infrastructure, and networks to encourage world leading quantum talent to base research and commercial activities in the UK."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,27,1,"International Partnerships Quantum science and technologies are a global effort. We want to work with allies and partners to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes, whilst ensuring that the UK plays a leading role. We already take an open and collaborative approach to our quantum research, with recent international network calls run by EPSRC alone resulting in UK universities partnering with organisations in 28 countries.28 The Quantum Technologies for Fundamental Physics (QTFP) programme, which started in 2020, has generated twenty-six unique international links from its seven large consortia across 9 countries.29 Our aims for international engagement are to: • Collaborate and share expertise with international partners on the opportunities, challenges and key uses of quantum, especially where technologies could help to achieve major societal goals (as set out in the Quantum Tech for Societal Good section). • Drive progress in quantum R&D by deepening collaboration with international partners, including those in Europe, and continuing to participate in leading multilateral research partnerships globally. • Lead the global definition of the risks and opportunities of quantum, and work with international partners to develop shared principles for the responsible and secure development and deployment of quantum. We are building collaborative relationships with a number of countries, such as under the Joint Statement of Intent with the US, which support mutually beneficial growth in our sectors. These will boost both research collaboration and connections between our industries. These relationships will also grow links between centres of excellence; running exchanges, workshops, and summer schools to support knowledge exchange; supporting intellectual property (IP) literacy; exploring missions or ‘grand challenges’ with leading countries around specific scientific breakthroughs or societal outcomes; and sharing access to key UK and international facilities. We continue to engage informally with other leading nations on quantum, to support open collaboration and a pro-innovation regulatory approach, which will help to grow quantum sectors and supply chains. This allows us to exchange information on our national quantum programmes, opportunities and challenges and identify areas for future collaboration. We also work with a broad range of countries through multilateral fora, such as the OECD and the Global Technology Forum, the World Economic Forum, the G7, and NATO, and take advantage of broader collaborative R&D opportunities born out of defence pacts such as AUKUS. International conversations on technical standards are at an early stage within standards development organisations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 28 Analysis by Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) 29 Analysis by Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), see technical annex for more details"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,28,1,"Standards Association, International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission. We will work closely with industry, academia, civil society and with international partners to ensure UK interests are represented at key standards and wider international bodies. To step up our international work on quantum we will: • Expand our partnerships through a comprehensive programme of bilateral arrangements with leading quantum nations, working with the UK’s global Science and Innovation Network, and considering the priorities and outcomes set in the forthcoming UK International Tech Strategy. • Engage with other leading quantum nations to exchange knowledge on quantum programmes, developments, regulation and security. • Increase our global networks through open calls on collaborative research. • Provide additional funding for international collaboration through the new International Science Partnerships Fund. • Take a leading role in multilateral fora to support UK quantum growth, for example through the OECD and the recently announced Global Technology Forum, the World Economic Forum, the G7, and NATO and look for broader collaborative R&D opportunities born out of defence pacts such as AUKUS. • Demonstrate UK leadership in international standards fora, optimising the conditions for UK companies and creating standards that are compatible with our norms and values. In November 2021 we signed a Joint Statement of Intent with the US to deepen collaboration on basic research, standards development and industry cooperation. NPL and NIST have agreed a formal collaborate on both R&D and standards development around quantum technologies. This collaboration act as a nucleus, growing to include other US laboratories and international partners. Joint research exchanges between UK and US partners will also be supported by NPL and EPSRC, beginning with summer schools in 2023 that also involve Canadian participants."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,29,1,"Goal 2: Supporting Business Support business, making the UK the go-to place for quantum businesses and an integral part of the global supply chain, as well as a preferred location for investors and global talent The UK quantum sector The UK has a thriving quantum ecosystem which provides huge opportunities to translate ideas into economic value and societal impact. There are already at least 160 companies active in the UK’s quantum sector,30 and our quantum companies have attracted more disclosed private equity investment than any other European country, second only to the US globally.31 The UK quantum ecosystem is comprised primarily of SMEs which operate in specific areas of expertise. This means collaboration is an essential part of the UK ecosystem - within the sector as well as with academia, allied sectors and user communities - and needs to be a fundamental part of our strategy going forwards. UK start-up Quantum Motion raises £42m to scale activities In February 2023, London based start-up Quantum Motion raised over £42m in equity funding from some of the world’s leading quantum investors (Quantum Insider). Quantum Motion are developing scalable quantum computers using existing silicon manufacturing processes. The funding round was led by Robert Bosch Venture Capital and supported by British Patient Capital, among other investors. The increasing frequency of larger UK investment rounds reflects progress technology development and an increasing awareness and confidence in the potential of quantum technologies. We will ensure that the UK’s start-ups and SMEs can thrive in the UK. The growth of the sector is reliant on a steady flow of newcomers into the ecosystem and the ability of SMEs to grow their quantum business quickly and accelerate the development of their technology. The UK’s start-ups also require continued support to manage the challenging “valley of death” stage of commercialisation, where products are still in the development cycle and the company is not yet making revenue. Success is dependent on a critical mass of companies as well as the ability of people, knowledge, and ideas to flow in and out of this ecosystem from surrounding industries, users, and academia. Enabling all of this to happen will be critical to securing the UK’s position as a global quantum innovation hub. 30 DSIT analysis combining Quantum Insider and ISCF data sets.

2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,30,1,"Working hand in hand with the quantum sector Growing the quantum sector in the UK will be a truly collaborative endeavour over the next ten years and beyond as the sector takes shape, with sufficient time, resource and effort dedicated to the task. We will work closely with quantum companies as well as key industry and professional bodies such as UKQuantum, the Institute of Physics, the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Engineering and Technology and techUK to make sure that industry views are understood and that government actions support growth. This engagement will cover areas such as the detailed design of the future R&D programme, skills, quantum readiness across the wider economy, international engagement, and the co-design of future regulation and standards. Commercialisation and Accelerators As outlined in the previous section, missions for quantum computing and PNT will include enabling activities to support commercialisation and user adoption in these technology areas. In addition, we will develop new acceleration programmes for quantum technologies that will support the sector to capitalise on market opportunities and build strategic advantage for the UK. Acceleration programmes will help to speed commercialisation, industrialisation, and linking the sector to end-users by focussing on systems integration, applications, and real-world demonstrations. They will build on, and expand, existing activities being delivered by the NQTP partners and enable greater participation from the growing UK sector. The specific investments and activities of an accelerator programme will be tailored to the technology areas and will include efforts to roadmap the route to market for key applications. We will continue to engage the community to help shape these programmes. We will also continue industry-led innovation funding opportunities, such as that provided via the ISCF quantum challenge. This will help de-risk investments over the medium to long-term and encourage new entrants to join the sector. The ISCF has an impressive track record of helping companies to secure investment alongside grant agreements, as well as helping to grow the pipeline of new start-ups through feasibility studies. Infrastructure The UK’s quantum facilities and centres of excellence are spread across all regions of the country. We have made significant investments in government-owned infrastructure to support industry and the development of new products based on quantum technologies. This includes expanding the facilities and capabilities at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington and establishing the National Quantum Computing Centre at the Harwell Campus in Oxfordshire. This is in addition to the network of research and innovation infrastructure built up in the existing Quantum Technology Research Hubs, and investment in wider capabilities such as"

The region is marked by the emergence and growth of innovative start-ups, leading manufacturers (such as Coherent Scotland and M Squared), and large defence systems integrators with strong laser and radar divisions. This is combined with a world-class research base, with several universities having extensive legacies in lasers and photonics as well as in quantum optics and cold atom work. The cluster is also supported by other leading research & development and innovation centres such as the James Watt Nanofabrication Centre based at the University of Glasgow, and the Li-Fi Centre at the University of Strathclyde. Helping to tie the ecosystem together is the Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics UK, a world-leading centre in applied laser research and development, based at the University of Strathclyde. The network of institutions in the Central Belt is closely tied to the NQTP, notably through the Quantum Imaging Hub (QuantIC) led by the University of Glasgow (partnered in Scotland with the Universities of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt and Strathclyde), but with the other three of the UK’s quantum technology hubs also having a strong presence in university physics departments in Scotland. Almost half of all Government-supported Commercialising Quantum Technologies Programme projects involve a Scottish organisation participant (UK Quantum Technologies Challenge, The Directory, UKRI). Wales semiconductor cluster Since 2015, the world’s first and only dedicated cluster in compound semiconductor (CS) materials and manufacturing has emerged in South Wales, support roughly 2500 high value jobs and a £1 billion expansion commitment (CSconnected, 2022 Year in review). Leading-edge university researchers have been brought together with high-tech companies focused on delivering market-ready products with critical application in quantum technologies."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,32,1,"This activity has been underpinned by the UKRI Strength in Places Fund through the establishment of centres of excellence, such as the Institute for Compound Semiconductors and a Future CS Manufacturing Hub, both located at Cardiff University, and the Centre for Integrated Semiconductor Materials at Swansea University. Exploitation across the supply chain is facilitated by research translation entities such as The CS Centre and The CS Applications Catapult. The industrial activity is driven by the presence of expanding global leaders: IQE, the market leader in supply of advanced compound semiconductor materials; KLA, a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, inspection and metrology tools, and Microchip Technology, a leading provider of mixed-signal and analogue semiconductor products. The NQTP seeks to build on this regional excellence. To date the cluster has been a UK manufacturing source for novel quantum components, and is the coordinator of the UK National Quantum Foundry. The next ten years of innovation will require access to the right research and innovation infrastructure to test, pilot and demonstrate the value of these technologies in the laboratory and real-world settings so that we can accelerate their path to market. The government has a role to play in providing critical infrastructure where access to equipment or facilities provides shared benefits. This includes, for example, facilities for testing and evaluation of technologies, which in turn builds confidence in system integrators, endusers, investors, and the manufacturers themselves. It also includes large national scale infrastructure for demonstrating the value of technologies in real world settings. This might include the development of future quantum networks with the ability to distribute quantum information and quantum-based references such as timing signals around the country between key locations. The commercialisation of quantum technologies, as well as other inter-related technologies such as semiconductors, is also likely to require fabrication facilities, and we will look at the different options for providing additional support in this area. To support the UK quantum sector, we will: • Launch missions for Quantum Computing and PNT that will include enabling activities to support commercialisation and user adoption in these technology areas (as outlined in the previous section). • Develop new acceleration programmes for quantum technologies that will support the sector in capitalising on market opportunities. Acceleration programmes will help to speed commercialisation, industrialisation, and linking the sector to end-users by focussing on systems integration, roadmapping, applications, and real-world demonstrations. We will start with an additional £20 million over the next two years to fund an accelerator for quantum networking, a collaborative programme with industry. • Launch a new round of industry-led innovation funding opportunities under the new tenyear programme."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,33,1,"• Work with industry to undertake feasibility studies on key infrastructure and programme requirements to enable the future benefits associated with quantum technologies to be better understood and realised, starting with quantum communications. • Commission the Royal Academy of Engineering to undertake an independent infrastructure review by the end of 2023 to map the UK’s quantum infrastructure and the sector’s infrastructure requirements for the next decade against those of other key UK sectors (such as semiconductors, photonics or space), including for fabrication facilities. This will help to identify where there is a rationale for Government to invest for the future, or where the UK should seek to partner with other nations to enable access to critical infrastructure. • Open-up access to the facilities of participating partners across industry, research organisations, universities, and government-owned facilities for testing, problem-solving, and performance demonstration. • Produce a directory of existing infrastructure accessible to industry across the UK and explore the quantum industry’s requirements for additional infrastructure over the next decade. • Work through the NQCC to negotiate access to quantum computing resources across a range of platforms for wider research and the quantum industry, providing a front door for those businesses looking to engage with the quantum community and explore use cases. We will provide an additional £20 million over the next two years to boost the work of the NQCC. Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics (CAP), Glasgow The Fraunhofer CAP UK is a world-leading centre in applied laser research and development. with important applications in quantum technologies. It is located at the Technology & Innovation Centre, University of Strathclyde. Fraunhofer CAP plays an important role in tying together the photonics and quantum cluster in Scotland by conducting industry-driven research to support the development of new products and their adoption. Fraunhofer CAP is responsible for enabling commercialisation of quantum technologies in many Government-supported projects under the National Quantum Technologies Programme. These have included the development of miniature devices such as lasers and photon sources, cold-atom sensors, and Optical Ground Receivers for satellite QKD. Fraunhofer also have a prominent position across other UK technology sectors such as space, defence, net-zero and health."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,34,1,"The UK’s business support offer The UK is well known for being a great place to start and grow a business, with considerable support available to companies. This includes: • The development of a central Government Innovation Hub to help to make sure all business support is available in one convenient place. There are a range of existing support mechanisms available to UK businesses to help them overcome the challenges of starting and scaling their business such as the Innovate UK: EDGE programmes, ICURe, and QUEST. • Digital guidance and tools from the Intellectual Property Office (IPO) to help businesses understand the IP system and take informed decisions on how to protect and commercialise their IP. The IPO also works in partnership to provide grant funding for innovative, high-growth potential businesses towards costs of professional advice and support for UK businesses to protect and manage their IP overseas through the International IP Service."

NPL are helping companies to bridge the gap from a technology prototype in a research environment to industry-ready, innovative new products."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,34,3,"• Advice and support to companies from the National Protective Security Agency (NPSA) (CPNI) and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) to help them to put in place protective digital and physical security measures to ensure the protection of assets which are necessary to support growth. • Support to businesses to help them export and grow into global markets from the Department for Business and Trade (DBT). This includes the provision of local market help to sell overseas, as well as connecting overseas buyers with UK business. DBT also help overseas business locate in the UK. They are also responsible for attracting inward investment, and have a support offer to help companies invest and expand in the UK. To continue to grow this offer and ensure quantum businesses can access the support they need we will: • Create a quantum business growth directory outlining the support offer for quantum companies to help them to flourish by taking advantage of the existing schemes available for innovative businesses, including helping to protect their intellectual property."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,35,1,"Investment to unleash innovation To develop a globally competitive quantum technologies sector we must ensure UK companies can access finance at all stages of growth. Quantum technologies can require large amounts of investment before they produce a return and have lengthy research and development cycles to reach the market, requiring more patient capital than some other technology sectors. Later funding rounds will be key to enable companies to scale-up and expand their manufacturing capabilities as technologies reach the market. This challenge is particularly important for quantum computing companies due to the large capital requirements for developing and scaling hardware. The UK is a great place for businesses to access the funding they need for innovation. During 2022, fast-growing UK tech companies continued to raise at near-record levels (£24 billion), more than France (£11.8 billion) and Germany (£9.1 billion) combined. This takes the total raised over the past five years to nearly £100 billion (£97 billion).32 The government remains committed to its long-term objective to mobilising more institutional investment into productive areas of the economy, ensuring that savers stand to benefit from the growth of the UK’s most innovative companies. We are taking action to deliver this objective and meet the 2019 manifesto commitment to ‘unlock long-term capital in pension funds to invest in and commercialise our scientific discoveries, creating a vibrant sciencebased economy post-Brexit’. The government is legislating to implement important regulatory changes such as reform of the pensions regulatory charge cap, which will provide clarity for industry and ensure pension savers stand to benefit from higher potential investment returns. We continue to engage closely with industry stakeholders to develop the most effective policies to support this objective. Government finance mechanisms The British Business Bank is an important delivery partner in our efforts to make finance markets for smaller businesses work more effectively, allowing those businesses to prosper, grow and build UK economic activity. Up to the end of 2020, the Bank had supported the provision of £42 billion worth of finance to 170,000 small and mediumsized businesses across the UK, not including its COVID-19 debt and equity finance schemes (UK Innovation Strategy). The Bank provides access to scaling capital at larger, later-stage funding rounds, through British Patient Capital (BPC) which, since its launch in 2018, has become the largest domestic investor in UK venture and venture growth funds (BPC). Its long-term investment approach helps UK companies access the right type of funding at the right time in their life cycle and is intended to demonstrate that a patient investment approach – which can support deeptech companies – can produce commercially attractive returns. 32 DCMS, Press Release, December 2022"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,36,1,"The British Business Bank has also launched Future Fund: Breakthrough, a £375 million UK-wide programme that will co-invest alongside private investors directly in later funding rounds at high-growth, innovative firms. The programme will focus on R&D intensive companies and will aim to accelerate the deployment of breakthrough technologies which can transform major industries, develop new medicines, and support the UK transition to a net zero economy. Technology is a focus area for the Future Fund: Breakthrough programme, with BPC seeing quantum computing as a future technology which has the potential to revolutionise a multitude of sectors, cementing the UK’s position at the forefront of global innovation. BPC have invested in Oxford Quantum Circuits’ £38m Series A funding round through its Future Fund: Breakthrough programme (BPC). The National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) is the Government’s corporate venture capital arm for dual-use advanced technologies. NSSIF invests commercially in advanced technology firms, alongside other investors, to support long-term equity investment. Because they co-invest, every pound they invest is leveraged by private investment. NSSIF’s quantum strategy aims to support a thriving UK ecosystem and deliver early quantum advantage for national security and defence. Through British Technology Investments Limited, which acts as NSSIF's direct investment arm, NSSIF has made direct investments in quantum technology companies. In addition, it has broad exposure to a range of other quantum firms via its indirect ‘fund-of-funds’ investments. Growing global supply chains The supply chain that underpins the quantum sector – whilst still nascent – is already truly global. Based on a survey of 54 relevant UK companies, 85% are importing elements of their supply chain to develop quantum technologies.33 UK companies are a key part of this global supply chain. We have industrial strengths and leading companies across the supply chain, in areas such as photonics, electronics and cryogenics, which are essential to quantum technologies. We have world leading clusters, such as the compound semiconductor cluster in South Wales, and a long-established photonics cluster in Scotland. To promote our companies in domestic and global supply chains and to boost investment, we will:"

Attracting quantum businesses to the UK Much of the UK quantum business sector is formed from homegrown talent, nurtured through our universities and quantum hubs or established in larger UK companies. There is also an important place for quantum companies from overseas in the UK ecosystem. The UK is already an attractive location due to our strengths in quantum science, our supply chain, our wider business-friendly environment, our support for innovation and our talented quantum skills base. For example, the recent return of quantum computing firm PsiQuantum to the UK, with the establishment of a quantum computing research centre in Daresbury in the North-West of England, demonstrated confidence in the competitiveness of the UK’s quantum sector. In 2021, IBM worked with the government to establish the Hartree National Centre for Digital Innovation, which brings together world-leading expertise in AI and quantum computing to support their application in industry and the public sector. We will: • Build programmes and investment opportunities that attract quantum companies from overseas. We will proactively support quantum businesses that want to come to the UK, working with the Department for Business and Trade."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,38,1,"Goal 3: Driving the adoption of Quantum Technologies in the UK Drive the adoption of quantum technologies in the UK to deliver benefits for the economy, society and for national security If the UK is to reap their full benefits, all sectors of the economy must understand the opportunities from quantum technologies. Industry, researchers, and the public sector will need to understand and explore how they can utilise quantum technologies to do things differently, or even doing things that currently aren't possible. This is challenging in an emerging sector where it is not always clear exactly how or when quantum technologies will offer a competitive advantage. A recent EY report found that only 25-33% of businesses had taken concrete steps to prepare for the arrival of quantum computing, despite 48% believing quantum computing will play an important role in their industries by 2025.34 We will raise awareness of the opportunities and foster the right connections to build an understanding of user needs. We will set direction and providing a signal of intent by focussing efforts on where quantum will deliver the most value for the UK. Below we have set out some of these areas of opportunity that relate to net zero, national security, health, digital innovation and critical growth sectors – particularly those relating to the other four technologies of tomorrow (AI, future telecoms, semiconductors and engineering biology). In previous chapters we have set out our missions-based approach which will galvanise research and innovation activities towards a defined societal benefit. The two tech missions in PNT and computing will be important testing ground for more ambitious future missions, which will include a focus on those applications that will have the greatest impact to drive early adoption in key sectors, such as financial services and life sciences. Developing testbeds for different hardware platforms is a focus of the current computing mission and we will look to expand these efforts as the technology develops. Bridging the gap between nascent technology development and end user applications will be an important role for the NQCC, with the potential for ambitious missions to drive largescale testing across selected sectors. This work will be supported by expanded government procurement activities, such as the Catalyst Fund set out later in this chapter, which will concentrate on pairing the capabilities of quantum with the government’s biggest challenges. 34 Ernst & Young, Quantum Readiness Survey 2022"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,39,1,"Quantum Technologies for Societal Good Quantum technologies will offer a step-change in performance across a wide range of applications and are enablers to wider innovation across the economy, with £100 billions of expected benefits estimated globally in the coming decades.35 Future applications of quantum technologies include: An environmentally sustainable and resilient UK: By mimicking nature a quantum computer could simulate new materials, accelerate improvements in solar panels and batteries, and help improve the efficiency of renewable energy sources. By modelling and optimizing logistics and traffic network flows, quantum computing could reduce carbon emissions as well as bring about significant efficiency savings. Meanwhile, by monitoring the emission of greenhouse gases, quantum sensors could help the UK to meet emissions targets and monitor compliance. Strengthened security, defence and resilience at home and overseas: By solving complex optimisation problems, and sending information in a quantum state we could improve sensor networks for defence purposes and enable autonomy through enhanced sensors. We could use quantum-enhanced machine learning for pattern matching, image and voice recognition and classification, and data fusion. The use of quantum computing and sensing on the battlefield could enable us to find targets of interest and enhance situational awareness. Quantum computers could solve complex calculations for modelling and improving performance on the battlefield. Short and long-range quantum communication systems may provide high bandwidth, secure point-to-point communications which cannot be intercepted and can be covert on deployable platforms. Quantum sensing, timing and imaging capabilities could provide the next generation of PNT capabilities to support troops on deployment, including in built-up urban environments where access to current systems is challenging. The UK as a world leader in health and life sciences: By solving complex logistical problems, quantum computing could help make hospital systems more efficient, improving delivery and reducing costs. Quantum computing could also analyse vast and unstructured data sets to speed up new drug development timelines and reduce costs. Better, cheaper or easier imaging will enable improved diagnostics and outcomes for patients, for example, for use during cancer surgery to remove damaged tissue, or to monitor epilepsy in children, or brain damage and concussion. The UK as a meaningful digital actor and unlocking the power of data for the UK: By accelerating optimization routines, quantum computing could enhance scenario planning, logistics and risk management within financial systems. Quantum computers may accelerate machine learning and provide reinforcement learning using unbiased data sets.

2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,40,1,"technologies could act as an enabler for the further development of smart cities through sensing, networking and compute capabilities. Supporting other UK priority technologies and sectors: As enabling technologies, quantum products and services will often unlock innovation through integration of a wider suite of technological solutions. Given the breadth of anticipated capabilities and advances in performance, they will also have applications across many sectors. This represents both a great opportunity and a challenge for commercialisation. Considerable work is required to understand the drivers and technological challenges within critical sectors of the economy. This includes future telecoms networks, the space, defence, health, AI, high performance computing, photonics and semiconductor industries. We must ensure that efforts to roadmap and support technological advances within other sectors are mindful of what quantum could offer and develop an integrated whole system approach, enabling suitable environments within which to test and demonstrate applications. Substantial work will also be required to integrate new quantum technologies into existing systems of classical technologies and to assure their capabilities. Quantum computing, high performance computing, AI and cloud computing: the case for convergence As quantum computing develops, we will need to take every advantage of synergies between capabilities and opportunities in other technologies. As set out in the independent review of the Future of Compute, high performance computing is required in the UK to accelerate and steer the development of frontier AI in a manner aligned with the UK’s values and objectives. Over the next ten years, quantum computing will be an important addition to the UK’s high performance computing ecosystem, where integrated hybrid solutions are likely to be critical to achieving the best results. Meanwhile, cloud access and orchestration of resources has the potential to make compute, including quantum computing, more accessible to a broad range of users. The NQCC is already supporting convergence through exploring quantum machine learning applications and identifying mechanisms for cloud access to quantum computing for UK industry and researchers. Work will also be undertaken to further understanding of the quantum sector’s needs for advanced computing capabilities and how we can meet the integration challenges. Given the early stage of technology development for quantum computing, awareness raising and upskilling users to explore potential use cases is challenging. But the requirement to engage early is critical. The NQCC will play a crucial role in raising awareness and improving readiness, as well as providing test beds and access to compute to enable use case exploration."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,41,1,"NQCC test bed for quantum computing applications The NQCC has developed an extensive programme of support for users under the SparQ Applications Discovery Programme, to help them understand the opportunities associated with quantum computing, including training programmes and hackathons. The programme is ensuring resources are in place to provide access to state-of-the-art quantum compute resources delivered via the cloud, applications expertise, sharing of best practise and technical support to help shape and drive industry adoption. Furthermore, the NQCC will ensure test beds are developed and supported to enable the UK quantum computing developer community. These will be a mix of hosted hardware for end user access, state-of-the-art cloud services and well characterised stable platforms with full stack access to support developers in understanding error causality, mitigation and correction on the road towards large-scale fault tolerant machines of the future. The NQCC along with the Quantum Software Laboratory at the University of Edinburgh will investigate emerging use cases with societal impact. The NQCC will also examine key challenges around scaling quantum computing machines; verification, benchmarking, and error correction. SparQ Applications Discovery Programme The SparQ programme, developed by the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC), will help UK-based companies and researchers in the early exploration of applications for quantum computing. The NQCC is teaming up with Oxford Quantum Circuits (OQC) amongst others, to provide businesses and researchers with access to quantum compute resources including emulators, simulators, annealers and gate-based quantum computing platforms. While many government and research institutions around the world have developed programs aimed at raising awareness about quantum, SparQ goes further to take industry and government users through a journey from awareness, to engagement, evaluation, action and advocacy supported through four key elements: access to quantum computers, technical support and applications expertise, workshops and networking opportunities and learning resources. These elements are all aimed at allowing potential users to gain early hands-on experience in working with quantum hardware and algorithms to address challenges that are relevant to industry. Critically, the program is not just for quantum computer scientists and researchers, but also industry end users – people who are most likely to take quantum know-how and turn it into real world applications."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,42,1,"Leading by example through government signalling and procurement There are many areas where quantum technologies could improve public service delivery and enhance government’s capabilities – from improving the way we monitor climate change from space, to providing the ability to sense underground objects to speed up major infrastructure projects. Government can act as an early adopter of emerging technologies to support technology development and demonstrate the value of technologies to other sectors of the economy. There are numerous examples where procurement has been used to drive innovation such as through the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) and the National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF), providing public service improvements for the government whilst supporting small businesses and stimulating markets. As part of NSSIF’s strategy, and to deliver insight and access to quantum computing for government, NSSIF has deployed £2.6m in R&D contracts with quantum companies, helping to stimulate growth in the UK quantum ecosystem. Defence is a key area where the government acts as an early adopter of emerging technologies. The MOD was a key partner in setting up the NQTP in 2014. MOD has identified key quantum technology applications for defence, including sensing, imaging, and timing, as well as subsequent near-term opportunities in communications and computing. MOD has shared its own novel S&T with the NQTP, while in turn drawing on the expertise within the programme. This has allowed the department to assess future challenges, understand applications and routes to exploitation, and ensure Defence is ‘quantum ready’. The MOD Science & Technology Strategy also outlines the government’s intention to be an understanding first customer, an early adopter of innovation and a customer that’s prepared to take some risk – taking relatively immature technologies and experimenting with them within Defence systems. MOD will send clear messages to quantum innovators and potential collaborators on the military challenges identified which may be addressed by quantum technologies, while also welcoming and encouraging novel ideas and opportunities that Defence may not have yet identified. Government will work across departments to explore other key public sector applications and consider how other departments can learn from this example. To drive the adoption of quantum technologies, we will: • Raise awareness of the opportunities associated with their use through sector specific engagement and showcasing, as well as demonstration activities through the R&D programme. • Accelerate the recently launched NQCC SparQ Applications Discovery programme, with specific workstreams dedicated to use case exploration, testing, and upskilling within the public, defence, aerospace, and healthcare sectors. This builds on existing work with the finance sector to understand key drivers and opportunities, with further work"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,43,1,"planned to ensure the sector is resilient to the threats to encryption from future scalable machines. • Expand the NQCC’s ability to act as a first customer on Government’s behalf by procuring prototype platforms and access to compute to accelerate the growth of the sector and enable sectors and government users to explore use cases. • Dedicate at least a quarter of the NQCC’s access to computing platforms and associated research programmes towards exploring critical applications of societal benefit, such as realising the advantages from personalised medicine, understanding the causes of dementia or improving battery efficiency. This will be delivered by working with leading UK centres such as the Crick Institute or Faraday Institution. • Deliver missions focussed on achieving societal benefits and commercial value, starting with two missions (accelerating quantum technologies for resilient capabilities in Position Navigation & Timing (PNT), and demonstrating the advantage of quantum computing). We will consult with the community and key industries both domestically and internationally to continue this work by developing a set of longer-term missions over the coming year. • Work with relevant leads across government to agree sector or tech specific action plans to better articulate the value proposition and resulting actions for enabling technological convergence. Early priorities will be telecoms, defence, space, AI, high performance computing and the semiconductor industries. • Expand the use of government procurement, including funding feasibility studies for companies to explore useful applications for public sector challenges. We will provide catalyst funding to enable this, under the next phase of the national programme, and will kick-start this with an additional £15 million over the next two years. • Set up a Government User Group to identify where quantum technologies are likely to offer an advantage to the delivery of public services and other public good applications, ways to help enable technology development for public service delivery, and ways to upskill government to enable the successful exploration of potential use cases."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,44,1,"Goal 4: Leading quantum regulation and protecting the sector Create a national and international regulatory framework that supports innovation and the ethical use of quantum technologies, and protects UK capabilities and national security New technologies present many unknowns in terms of regulatory challenges that may emerge as our understanding of how they will be used starts to grow. To prepare for future challenges, it is important to engage early in the debates that will shape future regulation through national and international fora where early work is underway to identify potential risks associated with the use of new technologies, and to develop shared taxonomies, languages, and principles to guide their future development. Eventually new standards, benchmarking and assurance frameworks will increase in importance to facilitate technological development as use cases become more evident, helping to set requirements for interoperability and to measure performance within key sectors. As the quantum sector evolves both nationally and internationally, we must anticipate and prepare for future regulatory challenges. We will ensure that regulatory frameworks drive responsible innovation and the delivery of benefits for the UK, as well as protecting and growing the economy and the UK’s quantum capabilities. Quantum regulation will need to be: • Stable, coherent and predictable • Agile enough to move quickly with technological development • Simple to understand and inexpensive to implement • Where possible, co-designed with industry • Focussed on innovation and industry-needs • Champion the transparent and ethical use of quantum technologies. There is an important opportunity for the UK to be at the forefront of quantum regulation and lead the way in trialling quantum technologies. We also have a key role to play in leading the international ethical and regulatory debate to ensure that regulation supports growth, the ethical use of quantum technologies and the UK’s wider interests."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,45,1,"World Economic Forum Global Future Council The WEF Global Future Councils network brings together global experts to discuss critical issues, generate insights and analysis, and collaborate in shaping agendas. In 2022, it published Quantum Computing Governance Principles for the responsible design and adoption of quantum computing for the benefit of society. These principles provide a taxonomy to help inform stakeholders and the broader public about the areas that quantum computing will have an impact and the opportunities and challenges that arise therewith. We will: • Ensure that future UK regulation of quantum technologies supports innovation, business growth and the ethical use of quantum technologies across the UK economy. • Lead the way in trialling quantum technologies in the UK, through establishing regulatory testbeds and sandboxes. • Play a leading role, with like-minded partners around the world, to shape international norms and standards relating to quantum technologies including those developed by multilateral bodies. • Play an active role in the World Trade Organisation, the World Economic Forum, the G7, the G20, OECD, NATO, the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth and the UN, including utilising the UK seat on the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) to ensure that quantum regulation supports UK business and innovation, that the UK’s wider prosperity, security and defence interests are represented and that we continue to uphold the UK’s values including those on human rights. • Commission the Regulatory Horizons Council to undertake a regulatory review of Quantum Technology applications. This will lead to the development of a work programme to guide the evolution of proportionate and pro-innovation regulation for the sector. Protecting the UK sector to support growth Whilst the government has an objective to support the growth of the quantum sector which is anticipated to lead to many benefits for society, the economy and national security, it also has a responsibility to ensure that the use of these technologies does not lead to harm or present a threat to the UK. The strength of the UK quantum sector attracts interest from hostile states who seek to develop their own capabilities or undermine ours. We continue to welcome trade and investment while ensuring that we protect the UK effectively from malicious practices which could have a damaging impact on our security and prosperity."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,46,1,"We have put in place measures such as the National Security Investment Act 2021, export controls, responsible research programmes, grant agreements and advice on IP protection to help companies and academic institutions to protect themselves from hostile actors who may seek to exploit their technology or knowledge. These measures are designed to support UK companies and research institutions to engage safely with investors, businesses and academics around the world, supporting future scientific advancements in quantum and enabling the continued growth of the sector. We will: • Work with our trusted allies to continue to monitor and review the impacts of current controls on the sector and any future changes to regulation, including the NSI Act, export control regimes, working multilaterally to anticipate future impacts and ensure that regulation aligns with prosperity and security goals. • Provide guidance to quantum businesses and researchers on how to work safely with others and how protect their work and intellectual property, including against cyber threats. Key regulatory frameworks Government guidance for academia (“Trusted Research”) and industry ( “Secure Innovation”), as well as wider advice1 is available through NPSA and NCSC. They seek to support the sector in navigating nuanced risks around state threats and the risks to collaboration, through a better understanding of due diligence on partners, identification of high-risk research or organisational key assets alongside appropriate security governance and risk management, which allows those organisations to make risk-based decisions about how to balance security with opportunity. This includes advice on undertaking security audits and mitigations with accredited risk consultants. The Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) ATAS applies to all international students and researchers (apart from exempt nationalities) who are subject to UK immigration control and are intending to study or research at postgraduate level in certain sensitive subjects. The subjects and research areas are those where knowledge could be used in programmes to develop Advanced Conventional Military Technology (ACMT), weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) or their means of delivery. Researchers and students in these sensitive subjects must apply for an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate before they can study or start research in the UK. The National Security and Investment Act (NSIA) (2021) The NSIA came into force on 4 January 2022, and gives the government powers to scrutinise and intervene in business acquisitions, such as takeovers, that may pose"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,47,1,"national security risks. It gives businesses and investors a clear and predictable screening process, so that they can continue to invest and do business in the UK with confidence. The Act requires particularly sensitive acquisitions to be approved by the government before they are completed, and this includes acquisitions in Quantum Technologies. Extensive guidance on the Act and how quantum technologies come into scope is available at gov.uk. Export Controls The UK’s export control regime, delivered by the ECJU, provides a consolidated framework to ensure that UK exports allow UK business to prosper without posing a threat to national security or violating our international commitments to non-proliferation, as agreed through treaty or multilateral export control groups such as the Wassenaar Arrangement. As is often the case for less mature developing technologies, there are few specific controls targeting quantum technologies themselves or the goods designed for research and development of such technologies. It is possible new controls may be introduced in the future as the technologies mature and their impacts are understood. Mitigating the risks associated with quantum As with any new technology, risks associated with the use of quantum technologies will continue to emerge. One of the most well documented is the risk quantum computing will pose to national cyber security in the future by threatening the security of much of the existing public-key cryptography, upon which the information sharing and trust mechanisms of most modern systems depend. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is the UK’s authority for cyber security and cryptography and has published guidance on the transition to quantum-safe cryptography, which is the recommended mitigation against this threat once products become available. In terms of Government’s own preparedness, mitigations have already been put in place for critical information and services. NCSC will continue to give bespoke advice to each sector through its resilience teams, and general advice on quantum-safe cryptography via its website. More detailed guidance for quantum-safe cryptography algorithms will follow the outcome of the NIST process, recommending specific algorithms for representative use cases. NCSC’s guidance for mitigating the risks from quantum computing is set out within the White Paper “Preparing for Quantum Safe Cryptography”. NCSC’s position is that robust and secure transition will take time to plan and deliver, and there is risk in beginning transition to quantum-safe cryptography before standardscompliant products are available. NCSC works with international partners to ensure our plans and guidance for transition to quantum-safe cryptography are aligned."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,48,1,"There are actions organisations can and should take now to manage that risk. Any organisation that manages their own cryptographic infrastructure should factor quantumsafe transition into their long-term plans and conduct investigatory work to identify which of their systems will be high priority for transition once standards-compliant implementations exist. Priority systems could be those that process sensitive personal data, or the parts of the public-key infrastructure that have certificate expiry dates far into the future and would be hardest to replace. Technical Standards The importance of standards is growing with the increasing globalisation of commerce, the emergence of new technologies and the need for interoperability. As technology progresses from initial research to prototype and product development technical standards become increasingly important, for example by supporting the consistent measurement of technology performance. Different types of standards activity will be relevant at different levels of maturity: from identifying critical measurements and taxonomies as part of basic research, to the metrics and benchmarking of prototypes, and the interoperability and certification of commercial quantum products. Different quantum technologies are likely to mature at different rates. While supporting the development of standards will be important to advancing open technological development, interoperability and trade, these activities need to take place at the right time to avoid stifling innovation by setting boundaries and requirements too early in the process. There is also a need to mitigate the risks of standards being developed by those who do not share our values and in a way that does not support the UK economy. Engagement with key stakeholders and experts in specific areas of quantum technology research and innovation will be critical to Government developing an understanding of this balance. There are a number of early quantum standardisation activities taking place globally with significant focus on quantum safe cryptography and QKD, with UK leadership in these areas. Standards development organisations with activity on quantum technology include: International Organization for Standardization (ISO); International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC); International Telecommunication Union (ITU); Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF); the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI); and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). We will: • Work through relevant global bodies to ensure that global quantum technical standards promote our prosperity and security interests, including accelerating commercialisation of quantum technologies and supporting the sector here in the UK • Work with key partners (e.g. the British Standards Institute, the National Physical Laboratory and MOD) to scope and identify the best approach to coordinating national"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,49,1,"engagement in priority areas of quantum technical standards development. Relevant industry, and academia will be engaged in these efforts to track priority standards activity, raise stakeholder awareness and develop roadmaps to support UK engagement with quantum standards development. Existing UK governance of quantum technical standards Quantum computing, quantum communications, quantum imaging and quantum sensors and timing are at different stages of standardisation activity and spread across several different International Standards Development Organisations (SDOs). The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has raised awareness of relevant standards activity amongst the Research Hubs, and has initiated engagement with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US. The British Standards Institute (BSI) coordinates UK engagement in quantum standards activity at ISO/IEC and at the European level in CEN/CENELEC. A BSI committee for quantum standards was established with NPL support in March 2021. So far its main activity has been to mirror and contribute to ISO/IEC/JTC 1/WG 14, Quantum Computing, and to the CEN/CENELEC Focus Group on Quantum Technologies (FGQT). Within government DSIT is responsible for quantum technology policy and for policy on digital technical standards, which includes standards for quantum and related technologies such as AI and telecommunications. Standards oversight and leadership will be provided by DSIT through partnership with NPL and BSI, bringing in other key organisations such as NCSC and NQCC in their particular fields. Assurance of quantum technologies Users of quantum technologies and other emerging technologies require some confirmation of the reliability, cost effectiveness, safety and security of the products or services that they want to acquire. Testing and evaluation as well as wider assurance plays a critical role in demonstrating that the technologies do what they say they will. It is too early in the development pathway of many quantum technologies to establish full assurance frameworks for their use, however extensive work has been undertaken at NPL and elsewhere to develop effective testing and evaluation techniques, working with industry through ISCF Quantum Challenge projects and their Quantum Testing and Evaluation (QTE) Programme. This will stand them in good stead for the development of future frameworks. The NQCC and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) are also working to develop open standards that build on benchmarking tools commissioned by the NQCC to enable comparisons to be drawn between competing quantum platforms. NPL and NQCC will develop an assurance and benchmarking programme of work to sit alongside the standards roadmap."
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,50,1,"Security assurance is as important as performance assurance to provide users with the confidence to invest in or adopt these technologies. As such, good security principles established by NCSC and set out in the Cyber Security Strategy 2022 should be adhered to and security must be seen as an enabler rather than an inhibitor or commercial success. By reducing cyber risks in their interactions with other businesses or users via the cloud, as well as ensuring quantum technologies are secure by design, quantum companies can maximise the economic benefits associated with quantum technologies. As set out in the Cyber Security Strategy, NCSC will work with the National Quantum Technologies Programme to develop a security model for quantum computers, which will help companies to design secure architectures, building on the Digital Security by Design programme and will continue to offer guidance to quantum companies to help them to operate safely on the cloud. The Quantum Metrology Institute at the National Physical Laboratory The Quantum Metrology Institute (QMI) at NPL was established in 2015 as part of the first phase of the National Quantum Technologies Programme. The QMI brings together all NPL’s capabilities in science, metrology and major facilities relevant to the understanding, development and test of quantum technologies. The QMI is a national capability for test and evaluation, accelerating the commercialisation of quantum technologies. NPL teams work in collaboration with industry and academic partners across the country focused on multiple scientific areas including quantum clocks, quantum communications, quantum computing, quantum sensors and quantum materials. Facilities are available to test and characterise materials, components and systems from the full range of technology areas. NPL offers schemes for industry to access these facilities and opportunities to collaborate with NPL scientists and engineers to address barriers to innovation, reliability and scaling of quantum systems. To expand these national capabilities in support of the quantum economy, a new facility – the Advanced Quantum Metrology Laboratory (AQML) – has been constructed on the NPL Teddington site. The AQML will give NPL even greater capacity to support the UK in the successful commercialisation and adoption of quantum technologies"
2,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,51,1,"Conclusion The potential benefits and opportunities of quantum technologies are vast and will offer advantages to the UK in meeting our economic, security, climate, health and societal aims. We are in a strong position to be a world-leading quantum nation, but we must continue to be bold and ambitious in our approach if we are to capitalise on our strengths and bolster our position in the global race. This strategy set out our deep long-term commitment to quantum technologies in the UK and the actions we will take to build on our advantages across a broad range of quantum technologies. To conclude, we will ensure that the UK is a leading quantum nation, building on the years of investment and progress already made in the vibrant UK quantum ecosystem. We will invest – at scale and over the long-term – in the cutting-edge science and the people who will deliver our success. We will support our quantum businesses who are driving the commercialisation of the technology and ensuring that the ideas and knowledge are translated into products and services that can be used across the economy to deliver benefits to all our citizens. We will work internationally to share and increase knowledge, build secure supply chains and collaborate on the most pro-innovation and ethical global governance and regulation of quantum technologies. In the words of the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, ‘We will make the UK the home for cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, the best place in the world to start and grow a quantum business, a leading voice in the international quantum and tech community, and a magnet for international quantum talent.’ At this relatively early stage in the development of quantum technologies, our approach is to strengthen the entire quantum ecosystem, by applying all the levers that the government has available. As the technology matures, and the successful technical solutions in particular areas become clearer, our programme might need to change and become more tailored. Engaging with the UK quantum community to understand what is working, and how the support needs to adapt, will be an essential part of our approach. We will consult widely on the design of the future programme. Implementation To achieve this ambitious programme of work we will bring a rigorous approach to implementation and delivery. This will be a collaborative effort across Government, academia and industry, and with our international partners. A new Office for Quantum will be the engine of our ambition, based in DSIT but integrating knowledge and expertise from across the community and will:"

3,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,2,1,"1 Quantum information science: the next technological revolution Quantum information science (QIS) applies the best understanding of the sub-atomic world—quantum theory—to generate new knowledge and technologies. Through developments in QIS, the United States can improve its industrial base, create jobs, and provide economic and national security benefits. Prior examples of QIS-related technologies include semiconductor microelectronics, photonics, the global positioning system (GPS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These underpin significant parts of the national economic and defense infrastructure. Future scientific and technological discoveries from QIS may be even more impactful. Long-running U.S. Government investments in QIS and more recent industry involvement have transformed this scientific field into a nascent pillar of the American research and development enterprise. The Trump administration is committed to maintaining and expanding American leadership in QIS to enable future long-term benefits from, and protection of, the science and technology created through this research. Based on the collective input of all the Government agencies invested or interested in QIS, this document presents a national strategic approach to achieving this goal. Specifically, the United States will create a visible, systematic, national approach to quantum information research and development, organized under a single brand and coordinated by the National Science and Technology Council’s (NSTC) Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science (SCQIS). These efforts will leverage existing programs and approaches, adapt to the changing and improving scientific and technical knowledge, reflect the best understanding of opportunities and challenges in QIS for the Nation, and take new steps where appropriate. The national effort will:  Focus on a science-first approach that aims to identify and solve Grand Challenges: problems whose solutions enable transformative scientific and industrial progress;  Build a quantum-smart and diverse workforce to meet the needs of a growing field;  Encourage industry engagement, providing appropriate mechanisms for public-private partnerships;  Provide the key infrastructure and support needed to realize the scientific and technological opportunities;  Drive economic growth;  Maintain national security; and  Continue to develop international collaboration and cooperation. The key next step will be to develop agency-level plans that address the identified approaches and policy opportunities in the next section, which will be integrated into an overall strategic plan. This will enable new opportunities on a ten-year horizon, possibly including: the development of quantum processors which may enable limited computing applications; new sensors for biotechnology and defense; next-generation positioning, navigation, and timing systems for military and commercial applications; new approaches to understanding materials, chemistry, and even gravity through quantum information theory; novel algorithms for machine learning and optimization; and transformative cyber security systems including quantum-resistant cryptography in response to developments in QIS."
3,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,3,1,"2 Summary of key policy opportunities The policy opportunities identified in this strategic overview are summarized below. Following these recommendations, along with detailed planning and coordination made possible by the SCQIS as well as engagement with stakeholders, is crucial for the United States’ future success. Choosing a science-first approach to QIS  Strengthen Federally-funded core research programs and use approaches ranging from distributed small grants to centers and consortia where appropriate, to support long-term QIS research  Foster dialogue and collaboration between quantum-focused researchers across disciplines, and engage the broader scientific community to highlight and share relevant scientific advances, and grow and coordinate the quantum research community  Establish and utilize a formal coordination body, such as the National Science and Technology Council Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science (SCQIS)  Focus on Grand Challenges as a mechanism for driving advancements in the science and technology of QIS, and encourage Federal agencies to identify, prioritize, and coordinate investment in both fundamental and applied challenges Creating a quantum-smart workforce for tomorrow  Encourage industry and academia to create convergent, trans-sector approaches for diverse workforce development to meet the Nation’s QIS needs  Use and enhance existing programs to increase the size of the QIS-ready workforce  Encourage academia to consider quantum science and engineering as its own discipline, with needs for new faculty, programs, and initiatives at all levels  Address education in the area of quantum science at an early stage, including elementary, middle and high school levels  Reach out to broader audiences by working with involved agencies and industry to highlight their investments, along with novel or unconventional approaches like utilizing art, media, and engagement with cultural institutions  Encourage the QIS community to track and estimate the future workforce needs of quantum industry Deepening engagement with quantum industry  Foster the formation of a U.S. Quantum Consortium with participants from industry, academia, and Government to forecast and establish consensus on needs and roadblocks, coordinate efforts in pre-competitive research, address intellectual property concerns, and streamline technology-transfer mechanisms  Increase investment in joint quantum technology research centers by partnerships between industry, academia, and Government to accelerate pre-competitive quantum research and development  Maintain awareness of how the quantum revolution may effect agency mission spaces and how agencies can nurture the adoption of quantum technologies within the Federal Government by cultivating potential end-user application spaces"
3,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,4,1,"Providing critical infrastructure  Identify critically needed infrastructure and encourage necessary investments by working with Government experts and stakeholders, as well as industry and academia.  Encourage agencies to provide the QIS research community with increased access to existing and future facilities and supporting technologies  Establish end-user testbed facilities along with training and engagement, thereby allowing Federal agencies and stakeholders to explore applications relevant to their respective missions  Leverage existing infrastructure, including manufacturing facilities that can be repurposed and expanded, to rapidly advance quantum technology development Maintaining national security and economic growth  Maintain an understanding of the security implications of the changing science and technology landscape in QIS  Promote mechanisms, such as the SCQIS, for all Government agencies to stay abreast of the defense and security implications of QIS technologies and help balance the benefits of economic growth with new risks created by the technology  Ensure consistent application of existing classification and export control mechanisms to provide the largest amount of information possible to American universities and industry about actions related to QIS research to encourage economic opportunities, protect intellectual property, and defend national-security-relevant applications. Advancing international cooperation  Seek to increase international cooperation with like-minded industry and Government partners  Ensure the United States continues to attract and retain the best talent, and has access to international technologies, research facilities, and expertise in QIS  Identify strengths and focus areas, as well as gaps and opportunities, of international actors to better understand the evolving international QIS landscape from both technical and policy perspectives. Next steps Government agencies have been asked to create detailed execution plans in support of these policy goals and informed by these policy options. Specifically, 1. Agencies participating in the SCQIS shall provide written plans for addressing the policy goals outlined here by the first quarter of 2019, or a later date as arranged with OSTP and the SCQIS. 2. Consistent with law, agencies shall convene stakeholders in consultation with OSTP and the SCQIS to identify Grand Challenges in specific sub-fields, such as: quantum accurate sensors, quantum sensing technology, applications of quantum networks, development of quantum-resistant cryptographic standards and systems, commercial possibilities for NISQ quantum devices, approaching the high-fidelity limit of qubit operation, and foundational new science from QIS."
3,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,5,1,"3 Challenges this strategic overview addresses The rapid growth of QIS and the expectation that this trajectory will continue over the next decade create unique opportunities and challenges for the U.S. research and development enterprise. Underscoring the Trump Administration’s commitment to advancing QIS, the NSTC elevated its work on the subject and established the SCQIS, which has identified four key challenges that need to be addressed with a whole-of-Government response. First, improving and facilitating coordination both within the Government and between public and private institutions will create a robust domestic ecosystem and provide worldwide leadership in this international environment. The Nation already has strong and diverse programs in QIS at the Federalagency level driven by individual mission spaces, as described in the Appendix. Similarly, companies have begun making major investments in the field, inspired by the promise of future applications. At the same time, foreign countries are making investments and seeking to build their own QIS base in competition with the United States. Coordinating U.S. efforts will take advantage of the Government and industry activities to maintain and accelerate U.S. leadership in QIS. Second, growth within industry, academia, and Government requires maintaining and expanding a broad and viable workforce—a quantum-smart workforce—able to enact critical elements of the research and development enterprise. Such a workforce will attract and retain key jobs throughout the Nation, and enable new industrial and academic efforts that rely upon QIS as a base technology. Third, future progress in QIS requires strong cross-community connections between disciplines, from physics to computer science to engineering. These interactions already occur through research collaborations, but would benefit further from formal interdisciplinary research and training programs at earlier levels of education. As growth continues, collaborations and cooperation—between disciplines and nations, between industry and academia—must be promoted, even as competitive pressures may make this more difficult. Fourth, significant uncertainty remains regarding the overall economic and national security impact of QIS research and development. With strong industrial engagement now beginning, it is crucial to maintain a culture of discovery. The likely best-use commercial cases of quantum devices are unknown at this time and must be found through research. Maintaining this focus, despite significant countervailing pressures, is necessary. The technologies that are anticipated to result from this approach may also play a role in solutions to some of the Nation’s most pressing national security concerns, but will require maintaining an understanding of national security implications of QIS. In order to maintain and expand American leadership in this critical technology given these challenges, we must improve our capacity for cutting edge research and development, expand the QIS-literate workforce, and seamlessly coordinate between government, academic, and private sector players. 4 Choosing a science-first approach to QIS Quantum information science—including concepts and technology that support revolutionary advances in computing, communications, and metrology—arises from a synthesis of quantum mechanics and information theory. It examines uniquely quantum phenomena that can be harnessed to advance information processing, transmission, measurement, and fundamental understanding in ways that classical approaches can only do much less efficiently, or not at all. Current and future QIS applications differ from prior applications of quantum mechanics, such as the laser, transistor and MRI,"
3,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,6,1,"by using distinct quantum phenomena—superposition and entanglement—that do not have classical counterparts. Even though its origins can be traced back to the 1960’s, QIS remains a rapidly evolving scientific and engineering discipline with substantial further discovery opportunities awaiting. This reflects the Government’s long support of basic research and development in this field. Even now, while prototype QIS applications, platforms and devices are becoming commercially available, new applications and platforms will likely come from protocols and approaches that are not yet invented. Thus, the Government should maintain robust and diverse platforms and research thrusts that continue to stimulate transformative and fundamental scientific discoveries by taking an approach that puts the science first. This will require strengthening core research programs and finding new methods to broaden collaboration and participation. To capitalize on QIS-inspired technologies and advance the science necessary to realize the associated gains, the development and pursuit of scientific and applied Grand Challenges will be the unifying strategy. Grand Challenges are those fundamental scientific or technology problems with answers that will be transformative for Nation and have broad economic and scientific impact. Potential solutions will take sustained investments for at least ten years and require multidisciplinary teams of researchers and technologists. Agencies, academia, and industry must work together to identify and prioritize Grand Challenges, as well as track their progress and reevaluate these scientific and technological opportunities as the research and development progress."
3,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,6,2,"Solving Grand Challenges and realizing the potential of QIS will depend on employing effective models of coordination and collaboration to tap the unique skills and perspectives from Federal agencies, industry, and academia, and to create and maintain a dialogue between quantum-focused researchers across disciplines. Towards this end, centers and consortia can be a powerful means of gathering and maintaining research communities that can sustain such long-term, curiosity-driven research. In addition, the SCQIS’s coordination role as well as mechanisms such as professional science and engineering society participation, coordinated Principal Investigator meetings, and dissemination of information through scientific journals, will help to highlight and share quantum scientific advances and to grow the quantum research community."
3,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,6,3,"Grand Challenge opportunities Quantum approaches motivated by Grand Challenges show promise for providing new capabilities and tools for sensing and metrology, communication, simulation, and computation. This is vital for fundamental research and promotes security, health, and the economy. For example, quantum sensing holds the promise to provide advanced sensors for military mission impact, to develop new measurement science and quantum-based standards, to improve navigation and timing technologies, and to environmental sensing in novel settings. Single-photon detectors may become possible at far infrared and microwave wavelengths to expand the range of discovery of the dark universe, while non-classical emitters could be integrated for sensing, communication, and computing systems at room temperature. Today’s noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) technology will offer insight into the scientific and technological advances that can address QIS Grand Challenges in areas such as machine learning, simulation of many-body systems for materials discovery, chemical processes, quantum field theory, and dynamics of biological processes. Early exploratory efforts in NISQ systems are already yielding new understanding of these problems. This can help overcome scientific and technological barriers for developing resilient and reliable devices, including networking and storage devices, as well as algorithms and error correction techniques."
3,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,7,1,"5 Creating a quantum-smart workforce for tomorrow Growing an American quantum-smart workforce with expertise in a broad range of physical, information, and engineering sciences is crucial for assuring sustained progress in QIS. However, America’s current educational system typically focuses on discrete disciplinary tracks, rarely emphasizing cross-disciplinary study that equips graduates for complex modern questions and challenges, prominently including QIS. While the responsibility of training students traditionally resides within the academic community, Government agencies and industry can partner with academia to meet the nation’s future needs. Fundamental research is the main mechanism for generating a qualified workforce in QIS. Within the context of the need for individuals with a broad mix of skills, support for the trans-sector and transdisciplinary approach to research is essential. Students trained in such an environment will be exposed to a diverse yet convergent set of disciplines, along with the associated tools and infrastructure. This will allow students to obtain qualifications and skills required by U.S. industry, national laboratories, and academia. Existing approaches of this nature include special research tracks in academic programs, early career awards from Government agencies, support for focused research groups, and coordinated training with industry. Using and enhancing these programs can increase the size of the QIS workforce. Furthermore, approaches that synthesize these programs, such as industrial collaborations that engaging with a central, fundamental research program, can prepare students with additional skills crucial to entering the workforce in the private sector to further U.S. leadership in quantum science and technology. Agencies will be encouraged to expand or develop specific programs that foster workforce development and build off each other’s strengths and mission. A number of agencies already have existing programs, such as the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program and the Accelerating Discovery Program; the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program and the Quantum Science and Engineering Program at the Department of Defense (DOD); Science Undergraduate Laboratory internships, the Graduate Student Research Program, and the Computational Science Graduate Fellowship Program at the Department of Energy (DOE); and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) joint research centers that combine Government researchers with university students, postdoctoral scholars, and faculty. These programs can be enriched, modified, and expanded when driven by agency need. Further improvements may include joining existing efforts of different agencies to increase impact, such as by creating joint early-career programs. Looking to the longer-term horizon, academic faculty provide the bedrock of training programs. Universities should be encouraged to address the workforce development needs by adding tenured or tenure-track faculty within the interdisciplinary themes associated with QIS and consider Quantum Science and Engineering as a discipline for future concentration, exemplified in steps such as creating new departments or thesis tracks. Other avenues include new undergraduate programs, engagement with industry and Government for internships and externships—predominantly for U.S. persons—and new professional development programs, including encouragement for creation of specialized technical programs. These students become ambassadors of their discipline while following a wide range of different paths in their careers, increasing the societal impact of quantum-science education. Beyond the university, outreach to a broader audience will be essential. A strong comprehensive program in K-12 computational and scientific thinking featuring computer science and physics must start with developing interest at an early stage.

This enables a direct and smooth transition to an industrial environment upon the TRIPLETS project completion."
3,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,8,4,"Workforce generation efforts and future U.S. workforce needs of the nascent quantum industry should be periodically assessed, through industrial engagement (described in the following section) and work with established STEM efforts. This information can help guide future programs to produce the diverse workforce needed to support the quantum ecosystem. In order to improve the workforce development program over time, an assessment plan of quantum workforce development activities should be encouraged to allow participants to select and expand the most successful strategies and adapt, change, or terminate what does not work. Collaboration with professional societies and organizations, industrial consortia, and local governments are other means of assessing workforce needs. 6 Deepening engagement with quantum industry The revolutionary advances expected to come from QIS have already led to substantial industry attention on QIS research and development. Both large companies and a variety of startups and small businesses are investing heavily in quantum sensing, networking, computing, and supporting technologies. Several have already realized or will soon unveil next-generation quantum sensors, entanglement distribution over small networks, and quantum processors in the 50-qubit range, with plans to continue on a rapid-growth trajectory. In view of the economic and national security importance of QIS the Government will develop means to coordinate with U.S. industry. A critical element in a robust quantum ecosystem is a strong base of quantum-essential supporting technologies that are not intrinsically quantum in themselves. Current examples include cryogenics, photonics, low-noise microwave amplifiers, and nanofabrication. Thus the consortium should work to identify and stay abreast of these evolving needs, as well as work in partnership with Government agencies and industry to nurture and grow these technologies in cases where they are weak or do not yet exist. Existing approaches such as SBIR and STTR programs that promote innovation for small businesses can be integrated with or combined with other approaches such as joint research centers. In addition, as a key mechanism for industry engagement, the Government should foster the formation of a U.S. Quantum Consortium with participants from industry, academia, and Government. Like prior consortia such as the Semiconductor Research Corporation, a consortium provides a forum for technical exchanges and discussions to establish a mutual understanding of QIS industry’s trajectory, opportunities, and critical technical gaps and projected needs (e.g., for workforce, infrastructure, standards, and road-mapping). Furthermore, the consortium can also provide a venue for joint publicprivate funding to address infrastructure and technology gaps, and key pre-competitive research and"

Additional input can be provided by advisory bodies as appropriate, such as the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as well as coordination with other NSTC subcommittees. Finally, joint research centers— partnerships between industry, academia, and Government—can Government Joint centers: U.S. Quantum • Workforce Consortium: • Incubation & • Pre-competitive translation • Needs assessment • New • Cooperative R&D applications End-users: • Consumers • Industry • Government Quantum Academia Industry accelerate pre-competitive QIS research and development, and in the process help address both the looming need for a greatly expanded and diverse quantum workforce and scientific and applied Grand Challenges. These centers can also facilitate and improve technology transfer from Government research labs. More generally, mechanisms such as incubators for translation from the lab to small companies should be expanded, and roadblocks removed where possible. For a meaningful collaboration environment to exist, intellectual property concerns will also need to be addressed and methods for realizing the development technology emphasized where possible. 7 Providing critical infrastructure The successful development of technologies based on QIS will enable increasingly more advanced quantum research, but hinges on the availability of suitable tools, facilities, and other infrastructure items. The QIS research and development enterprise is not yet large enough to sustain an industry focused on developing and supplying all the necessary infrastructure. A targeted expansion of the relevant Federal and industrial infrastructure and support activities is needed to accelerate progress and prepare Federal agencies and industry to adopt the ensuing quantum technologies. The U.S. Government can play a critical role in fostering this field by encouraging programs that target the development and fielding of supporting technologies, ranging from component technologies all the way to sophisticated fabrication and characterization technologies. Agencies will be encouraged to explore mechanisms to provide the QIS research community with increased access to existing and future Federal facilities, including manufacturing facilities that can be repurposed and expanded as well as systems and testbeds for post-quantum applications. As some of these infrastructure"

The Government will encourage this culture, and the interagency process will provide a sounding board for promulgating such shared interest and promoting the leveraging of Federal investments in advancing each agency’s mission. Furthermore, it will explore methods to spur engagement from those end-user agencies that have not yet played a role in developing the technology, but could benefit from the output of this research. Indeed, the impact of QIS will be felt broadly, and it will be important for each agency to be aware of how the quantum revolution may augment its mission space.

At the same time, creating new markets and industries enhance our ability to address national security needs, but the scientific and economic advances can lead to new risks. An appropriate balance between growth and risk can provide long-term benefits. The technologies that are anticipated to result from intensified research and development in QIS may provide solutions to some of the nation’s most pressing national security concerns. For example, advancements in quantum computing may allow for improvements in effective drug discovery, modeling of chemical reactions to enhance corrosion-resistant materials, and optimizing logistics solutions. These and other opportunities in networking and sensing can play a positive role in ensuring national security and defense. However, there may be challenges to public safety and security that arise from these same technologies. For example, one key quantum algorithm will be able to break public-key cryptography, which secures transactions over the internet. While employing this algorithm is far beyond the current level of technology, the need to protect sensitive data and provide a reliable infrastructure over the long-term requires moving to “post-quantum” or “quantum-resistant” forms of cryptography. QIS technologies being developed for military and defense applications can also accelerate advancements in the field, leading to substantial economic growth potential through the creation of new industries and products and their transition to consumer markets. The defense and intelligence communities have been strong investors in QIS research and development over the last twenty years, and continue to work across the basic science and applied technology areas to improve the understanding of what is possible with QIS and support the necessary technological base.

Considering the global nature of scientific and industrial enterprises, the United States, including the private sector, has cooperated with foreign partners in QIS research for more than twenty years. These partnerships have accelerated scientific discovery and technological applications while promoting U.S. economic growth and national security. In order to maintain U.S. leadership and competitiveness in QIS, the United States must work with international partners, even while advancing domestic investments and research strategies.

3,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,14,1,"Appendix: Current U.S. leadership in QIS research areas The United States sustains a vibrant community in QIS. World-leading research groups in the Nation’s universities, companies, and national labs have driven progress in many of the critical areas of quantum computing and quantum systems for time-keeping, sensing, networking, and other applications. This status as a leader in quantum research and development is a direct result of the U.S. Government funding agencies and institutions sustained investment in basic and applied research. Both broad and focused programs, built atop a foundation of well-staffed and well-equipped research institutions, have created a talented workforce, encouraged broad innovation and exploration, and dedicated the necessary hard work in physics, materials science, and associated areas necessary to make progress in the development of working, controllable quantum systems. Throughout this effort, the United States has benefited from a many-headed funding model where, for example, one Agency continues to fund critical topics as another changes focus. Furthermore, combining funding driven by mission needs to ensure long-term development with science-driven funding to create the new ideas that seed further innovation provides additional resiliency. Progress in QIS has recently begun a significant expansion from increases in private sector research and development. Over the last five years, particularly in quantum computing, large IT companies and the venture capital and start-up community have engaged with new QIS opportunities and formed groups and companies to pursue commercialization. It should be noted that all this is possible because of the wealth and know-how that these companies and communities gained from the previous computing and internet revolutions they helped create. The national strategic approach should continue to leverage these strengths of both the U.S. Government funding system and the U.S. innovation ecosystem. Finally, significant contributions to QIS research have been made in other countries. The field has advanced in the United States in some part by recruiting, collaborating, and competing with science around the world. As a case in point, the first two-qubit gate proposal came from researchers in Europe, but was demonstrated in the Nobel-prize winning group of David Wineland at NIST. This reflects the increasingly global character of the science and technology enterprise. In a field where scientists are still very much fighting nature itself to make progress, humanity’s combined effort may be necessary to tackle the challenge. U.S. leadership at this juncture will provide the key ingredients for this success. QIS comprises fundamental science and technology across many platforms and topics, and touches upon many agencies. This includes the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of the Interior (DOI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State (State), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Security Agency (NSA), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). The SCQIS assesses the national portfolio using seven broad categories: four in fundamental science (S1-S4) and three in technological development (T1-T3). S1. Quantum sensing: leveraging quantum mechanics to enhance the fundamental accuracy of measurements and/or enabling new regimes or modalities for sensors and measurement science [DOD, DOE, DHS, DOI, NIST, NSF, ODNI] 14"

Current Federal agencies conducting or funding these topic areas are identified above. These seven areas represent the broad foundation necessary to support a full industrial and Governmental effort in quantum information science and technology. The SCQIS also has examined current funding, and finds at the present time that it is primarily focused on S1-S4, as shown in the graph below.
