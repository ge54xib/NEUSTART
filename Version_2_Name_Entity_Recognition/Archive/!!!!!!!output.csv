Potential applications include submarine detection, mineral exploration, imaging and sensitive radar detection.  • Quantum materials Materials with unusual magnetic and electrical properties that could enable energy-efficient electrical systems, better batteries and the construction of new types of electronic devices."
19,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Talent  The importance of recruiting, retaining and developing quantum talent in academia, industry and government was prominent in stakeholder feedback, as was the value of expanding national support for cutting-edge research to help retain and attract top talent and foster a vibrant start-up community. The importance of fostering a diverse and inclusive quantum workforce was also emphasized.  In addition to quantum physics knowledge and experience, feedback suggested that future success requires harnessing expertise in a wide variety of fields, such as social science and humanities, business, and engineering.  Increasing industry-academia collaboration was noted as a way to draw research talent into industry, increase commercialization, and ensure strong readiness to engage and create value from quantum applications. Training and internship programs that provide work experience and cross-disciplinary skillsets were also identified as key to advancing research toward commercialization.  Stakeholders stressed the need to expand efforts to attract international talent. They suggested creating mobility programs that offer international training and internships, adopting immigration measures, developing agreements with other countries, and facilitating access to international talent to complement Canada’s home-grown supply."
20,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Commercialization  Stakeholders acknowledged that Canada has expertise in many technologies with near-term commercial opportunity, including quantum sensors, which can be used to increase the competitive advantage of mining and defence sectors; quantum communications and cryptography; and quantum computing hardware and software, including algorithm design.  Quantum technologies are evolving quickly; however, they have lengthy development timelines and require long-term R&D support. Even when a quantum innovation reaches the proof-of-concept stage, intensive research is still needed to scale it into a commercially viable technology. Participants in the consultations felt that this interplay underscores the importance of industry-academia-government collaboration throughout the development lifecycle.  As Canada’s domestic market is small, its quantum strategy needs to leverage international partnerships and markets. Given the modest number of large Canadian first-buyer companies, stakeholders noted the importance of the Government of Canada as a first buyer, and felt that government procurement will be pivotal to de-risk product development and secure commercial success."
21,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Security  Stakeholders put high priority on the timely development and adoption of post-quantum cryptography. Quantum computing presents a significant cyber-security risk, as it has the potential to break current security algorithms, including those commonly used over the Internet. Quantum computing-enabled malicious cyber activity could put personal information, financial systems, utility grids, infrastructure and national security in peril.  The interoperability of existing and new systems will also be a major issue, as transitioning to new cryptographic technologies may take years. Stakeholders proposed that Canada invest in a parallel infrastructure for secure communications for highly sensitive information using quantum technologies, including critical space-based infrastructure. Given the dual use nature of the technologies involved, stakeholders recognized their importance to Canada’s economic and national security and suggested that foreign collaborations focus on trusted allies."
22,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Other input  Stakeholders also identified the importance of protecting and mobilizing intellectual property (IP). While the general view was that IP derived from publicly funded research should accrue benefits to Canada, consultation participants recognized the need to strike an appropriate balance between restrictiveness and openness to avoid unintended barriers to development, commercialization and international investment. For companies seeking investments so they can scale, the risks to Canadian IP relate to maintaining equity and to mergers with or acquisitions by foreign-owned companies.  Stakeholders said Canada needs to take a leading role in the development of mutually advantageous international standards to facilitate collaborative research and enable future opportunities for Canadian industry. Stakeholders also noted that Canada should contribute its perspective on the ethical use of quantum innovations. It was suggested that the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council (SSHRC) could fund studies on the societal and ethical considerations of quantum technologies.  Ongoing discussions with stakeholders, along with proactive engagement with end users, will be vital to providing social and economic benefits to Canadians through the development and application of transformational innovations."
23,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"T his strategy recognizes strengths that have  built up over many years of hard work and  investments, and represents a new chapter in Canada’s quantum story. The National Quantum Strategy (NQS) aims to amplify Canada’s significant strength in quantum research; grow Canadian quantum-ready technologies, companies and talent; and solidify global leadership in quantum science and its commercialization. The Government of Canada will continue to engage stakeholders to ensure that the NQS remains on the right course.  The Government of Canada has committed an incremental $360 million over seven years, starting in 2021–22, to support strategy implementation. In addition, support for a quantum-enabled future will leverage a number of current and anticipated broadbased, large-scale government programs that are critical to expanding Canada’s strength in quantum research, innovation and commercialization, and can be key instruments in advancing the growth and success of the Canadian quantum ecosystem.  Examples include:  •  The Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF), which supports large-scale, transformative and collaborative projects that promote the competitiveness of Canadian industries, advancement of Canada’s technological advantage and clean growth; and"
24,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"•  The Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), which provides investments in infrastructure across the full spectrum of research."
25,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Budget 2022 also announced the government’s intention to establish a Canadian innovation and investment agency. This agency will work to help new and established Canadian firms innovate, commercialize research, and create new economic opportunities for workers and businesses in Canada.  A broad range of complementary government programs and initiatives from a number of departments and agencies that support quantum research, development and deployment will also be leveraged to support the goals of the NQS, and are described throughout the document.  As quantum science and associated technologies mature, the Government of Canada will consider further actions to meet the needs of the quantum community, support excellence and ensure Canada’s continued success.  While many basic and applied research problems and technological challenges remain concerning the development of quantum technologies, the next wave of disruptive innovations is becoming clearer, as are the areas in which Canadians are poised to lead the world. In addition to continuing to make diverse investments in quantum R&D, it is also time to concentrate on key areas of Canadian leadership and double down on specific goals to benefit the economy and society—such as creating industries and jobs of the future, expanding the frontiers of quantum research, and solving important problems facing Canada and the world.  In light of this, and based on feedback from the stakeholder community, the NQS is focused on three missions:  •  Make Canada a world leader in the continued development, deployment and use of quantum computing hardware and software—to the benefit of Canadian industry, governments and citizens."
26,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,•  Ensure the privacy and cyber-security of Canadians in a quantum-enabled world through a national secure quantum communications network and a postquantum cryptography initiative.
27,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,•  Enable the Government of Canada and key industries to be developers and early adopters of new quantum sensing technologies.
28,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"THE STRATEGY’S THREE MISSIONS IN DETAIL  The NQS missions will guide collaboration between academia, industry, not-for-profit organizations and government—and require government support to de-risk technology development, scale solutions into world-leading prototypes and launch large-scale projects that establish Canadian leadership.  In the near term, the Government of Canada is planning to launch road-mapping exercises and develop technical guidance in collaboration with academic and industry experts to complete a more detailed rollout plan for these missions. These roadmaps will include detailed objectives, milestones and actions required of government, academia and industry to realize mission goals. Informed by these roadmaps, the Government of Canada may explore additional investments and work with provinces, territories and other partners to support each of the missions.  In advancing the NQS missions, it will also be important to emphasize a number of key enabling factors that will be vital to success. These include critical infrastructure, supply chain issues and standards.  Critical infrastructure is an important enabling factor, including strengthening support for operating existing infrastructure, and filling key gaps required for the success of Canada’s quantum industries.  Supply chain issues need to be considered to ensure that Canadian quantum researchers and companies have stable access to critical components, either domestically or through enhancing supply chain security in collaboration with international partners.  Standards will play an important role in the commercial success of quantum technologies by opening up access to international markets. The Standards Council of Canada and other organizations will contribute to activities that support standardization, including the development of policies and regulations for integrating and adopting quantum applications in ways that benefit Canadian business and society. As stakeholders expressed, Canada must be represented at various tables to ensure that international standards reflect Canadian principles and global frameworks reflect the interests of Canadian industries."
29,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Mission: Make Canada a world leader in the continued development, deployment and use of quantum computing hardware and software—to the benefit of Canadian industry, governments and citizens.  Forecasts anticipate quantum computing hardware and software will account for up to US$154 billion in global economic activity by 2030.4 Canadian researchers and companies are at the forefront of the international race to build a scalable highperformance quantum computer. Several Canadian firms now have quantum computing systems that have the potential to solve computational and logistical challenges that are too complex, costly or time-consuming to solve with conventional technologies.  Canadians are also leaders in the development of software to control quantum computers and link them to classical computer systems, and in the creation of applications that will make these systems valuable to end users. This advantage could benefit Canadians by transforming a number of sectors, for example by developing personalized drugs, making Canada’s supply chains and delivery routes more efficient, predicting weather events, modelling climate change, and more.  Early sectors of focus could include digital security, banking and advanced manufacturing. Many of these are already considering quantum computing. For example, the Bank of Canada collaborates with a broad range of Canadian and international quantum researchers, the public sector, and industry to stand at the forefront of this technological evolution.  A number of key research and development issues need to be addressed to realize the potential of a quantum computer. Near-term areas that will require a sustained focus include:  •  Hybrid computing capacity – Exploiting the full benefits of quantum computing will require interconnected systems of quantum computers and classical computers, to make use of what each type of system does best in a complex calculation, and to make it easy for users to access and use quantum computers, including over the cloud."
30,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"•  Quantum simulators – Before “fault-tolerant” quantum computers are available, it will be important to have a strong capacity to simulate quantum calculations to better understand the types of problems that can best be addressed by these systems, and to test how different hardware approaches would perform without having to invest in a range of prototype systems."
31,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"•  Use cases for quantum computers – In addition to developing quantum computing hardware and software, the full range of potential applications to real-world problems remains uncharted. Identifying"

44,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,•  Identify use cases and pursue procurement opportunities for quantum computing systems and software within the Government of Canada.
45,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Mission: Ensure the privacy and cybersecurity of Canadians in a quantumenabled world through a national secure quantum communications network and a post-quantum cryptography initiative.  Activities vital to our everyday lives—including commercial and financial transactions, government service delivery, the development and maintenance of transportation and utility infrastructure, ensuring the defence and security of Canadians, and more—depend on secure data usage, storage and  transmission.5  Quantum technology advancements could put the security of digital data and systems at risk due to their potential to break many of the cryptographic mechanisms currently used to protect personal, research, commercial and government information. Encrypted information transmitted today can be stored to be compromised in the future by a powerful quantum computer. Quantum-safe solutions using quantum technologies or post-quantum cryptography can protect data against this threat.  There is an immense commercial market tied to transmitting and securing data and increasing the inter-connectedness of devices. As well, there is an opportunity for the Government of Canada to adopt quantum-safe solutions in the future as they become commercially available. It is imperative to develop capabilities in secure quantum communications and post-quantum cryptography to safeguard citizens and strengthen the economy.  Achieving this will require developing partnerships among government, researchers and industry; investing in post-quantum cryptography; and building on Canada’s early strengths in secure quantum communications to work toward a national secure quantum network. Canadian systems must also be able to interface with those of international partners to provide maximum economic benefit and inspire confidence in the integrity of data.  Canada is home to pre-eminent researchers and companies developing post-quantum cryptography to secure valuable data. These capabilities are of value to both Canadians and allies as the Government of Canada works collectively to ensure the security and wellbeing of its citizens.  Ultimately, a national quantum communications network combined with post-quantum cryptography could enhance the security of highly sensitive information, critical applications and infrastructure. Such a network would include land- and satellitebased infrastructure significantly beyond current Canadian and international capabilities. In the future, a “quantum Internet” could also be used by Canadian industries, such as the financial sector, that need to transmit highly sensitive information and ensure their networks are interoperable with those of trusted international partners. Completing this mission would create a made-in-Canada quantum communications solution that would secure the Canadian economy and digital sovereignty and build confidence in Canadian providers of quantum-safe communications solutions among our trusted international partners.  The Government of Canada will also prioritize the formation of domestic and international industry-academia partnerships to build quantum cyber-security capacity. This will involve training and mobilizing experts to advance quantum cryptography and quantum communications, as well as expanding the pool of talent skilled in integrating quantum communications and quantum cyber-security technologies in different industries and sectors. Support will be required to develop commercially viable quantum key distribution, continue engagement in standardization activities and integrate cryptographic schemes with existing security-based software architecture. In the long term, conformity with industry standards will be an important factor in procuring solutions.  Work on this mission has already begun. The Government of Canada, led by the Communications Security Establishment, has undertaken activities to ensure that its highly sensitive data holdings are protected against the quantum threat. These activities are coordinated with international allies to maintain interoperability. The identification of Government of Canada systems and data that are less sensitive but still potentially at risk is an ongoing effort, and the use of standardized post-quantum cryptography will be critical to securing them.  Additionally, in 2017 the Government of Canada initiated the Quantum Encryption and Science Satellite (QEYSSat) project with several government organizations, academic institutions and private  Mission strategy  partners. The project is one of the first tests of satellite-based secure quantum communications demonstrations and is expected to be launched in the coming years. The NRC’s High Throughput and Secure Networks Challenge Program has been supporting collaborative R&D projects on quantum communications with industry, academia and other government departments since 2019. In June 2022, ISC launched a call to support pre-commercial quantum communications prototypes that can be tested in real-life settings and address a variety of federal government priorities."
46,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"The Government of Canada will work toward ensuring existing and future data systems are protected before they are threatened. This involves encouraging the deployment of post-quantum cryptography and working towards the development of a national quantum communications network that could be used to protect highly sensitive information in the future. To create opportunities for Canadian firms to enter international markets and enhance the collective security of Canada and its allies, the Government of Canada will seek to ensure Canadian systems can interface with those of our partners.  What’s required  •  Encourage organizations to understand the sensitivity of their data assets."
47,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,•  Develop a plan to enhance the security of these digital assets.
48,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,•  De-risk investments related to private sector development of distributed quantum communications infrastructure and new enabling technologies such as post-quantum cryptography.

55,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,•  Collaborate with allies so Canadian innovations enhance the collective security of sensitive information and gain international market access.
56,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Mission: Enable the Government of Canada and key industries to be developers and early adopters of new quantum sensing technologies.  Quantum sensors will significantly improve the precision, sensitivity and efficiency of many different kinds of measurements and, in some cases, create entirely new capabilities and application spaces to explore. The deployment of quantum sensors is expected to help solve many pressing problems for Canada by enabling major advances in defence and security, critical mineral exploration and extraction, infrastructure and environmental monitoring, navigation and transportation safety, and health care. Early commercial opportunities are on the horizon, with more widespread impacts expected in the next few years. By 2026, the global market for quantum sensors is projected to be nearly US$550 million.6  Canada will need to be an early mover to seize a share of that growing market. This will involve overcoming current technological barriers, including gaps in the fundamental science; challenges building stable and easily reproducible components; and the lack of standards, processes and devices to characterize components and systems. Barriers related to the highly specialized knowledge and training required for quantum-sensor use must also be overcome to enable their widespread adoption in society.  The NQS will help overcome these hurdles and support a vibrant domestic industry by leveraging Canadian quantum R&D capacity to create IP, build highly qualified personnel capacity, and stimulate knowledge and technology transfer between the government, academic and commercial sectors. The Government of Canada will engage industry end users on the capabilities and competitive advantages of quantum sensors to facilitate their adoption and will support expert training in the technology. Research and design of new materials, such as those that enhance the capabilities of existing sensors, will further contribute to fulfillment of the mission.  Work on this mission has already begun. In 2019, the Department of National Defence (DND) launched an IDEaS call for solutions to overcome the scientific and technical barriers to quantum-sensing systems for defence and security purposes. In 2021, the NRC launched the Internet of Things: Quantum Sensor Challenge program, focused on developing revolutionary sensors that use the extreme sensitivity of quantum systems to enhance measurement precision and sensitivity rates, and even expand the kinds of phenomena that can be measured. In February 2022, Innovative Solutions Canada (ISC) launched two calls to advance quantum sensing prototypes and supporting technologies: one to support the development of a quantum-level biophoton optical imager and another to develop ultrasensitive spectroscopy systems for quantum photonics. In June 2022, ISC launched a call to support pre-commercial quantum sensor prototypes  that can measure a variety of physical quantities, including electric or magnetic fields, precise timing, temperature, and chemical or biological processes. As a world leader in quantum science, Canada can conquer the technical challenges, transition these technologies out of the lab and into the field, and lay the groundwork for a future lucrative, hightech industry.

67,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Research: Developing better solutions  Continuing to support Canada’s research base is essential to ensure leadership in quantum science and technology. Basic and applied research to better understand and exploit quantum phenomena will continue to be important over the long term, as many impactful quantum innovations have yet to be discovered.  Without world-leading research, Canada will not have the expertise to advance the frontiers of quantum science, anchor talent development and create spinoff companies to commercialize products. Research in related fields, such as business and the social sciences and humanities, is also required to understand the social and economic impacts of quantum technologies.  Canada is at the stage where enhanced scale of effort and collaboration are critical to realize the promise of quantum technologies.  Institute for Quantum Computing  The IQC is a cross-disciplinary institute within the University of Waterloo with more than 300 researchers. Its mandate is to engage in research, training, educational outreach and device fabrication related to quantum information science and quantum technologies. Over the past 10 years, the Government of Canada has provided $51 million to support the IQC. The IQC is part of a quantum ecosystem that extends from discovery research in advanced physics at the Perimeter Institute to advanced development and commercialization at the Quantum Valley Ideas Lab.  Actions to date  Over several decades, Canada has supported research through competitive peer-reviewed programs and targeted investments in research institutes and hubs. One major Government of Canada program is the Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF), which helps competitively selected Canadian postsecondary institutions turn their strengths into world-leading capabilities. CFREF has invested $176.3 million in quantum projects to date.  QEYSSat  The Canadian Space Agency’s QEYSSat will  be a low-earth orbit satellite with a quantum  receiver and transmitter, capable of quantum  key distribution with a ground station. The  QEYSSat mission is intended as a scientific  platform and demonstrator for Canada, offering  a unique opportunity to implement satellite based quantum communications and perform  cutting-edge scientific experiments.  In addition, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) and the CFI have provided more than $200 million and $180 million, respectively, in funding to quantum researchers since 2012.  Peer-reviewed research funding has revealed and strengthened regional expertise, with investments fostering the development of key regional quantum hubs in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. Centred on universities with significant strengths in quantum research and training, these hubs have increased their collaboration and output, and exploited synergies across areas of quantum research to deliver significant advancements in quantum technologies. Collectively, they comprise more than 100 ecosystem players.  The Government of Canada has supplemented the CFREF, NSERC and CFI supports with additional investments, including in key components of the Quebec and British Columbia quantum ecosystems, such as the MiQro Innovation Collaborative Center (C2MI) and the Quantum Algorithms Institute.  While each regional hub covers a range of quantum science areas, and the hubs have been broadening linkages to expand their reach, no single hub can do it all. The next steps are to deepen collaborations while continuing to exploit synergies, and to further network activities and resources across the country.  The way forward  While continuing to support basic and applied research, the Government of Canada will seek to advance quantum technologies by enabling academic researchers to participate in largerscale research partnerships. These will be aimed at growing knowledge of how quantum systems work, developing new technologies and inventing new applications. Expanded partnerships between academia, industry, government and like-minded nations are essential to translate quantum research into societal benefits for Canadians.  Supporting key grant programs  The Government of Canada supports quantum science through existing competitive programs, including NSERC’s Alliance Quantum grants.  NSERC Alliance grants are a flexible instrument, allowing for support of multiple types of collaborations. These grants support research projects led by strong, complementary, collaborative teams to generate new knowledge and accelerate the application of research results, to create benefits for Canada. Alliance Quantum funding opportunities support the NQS by advancing Canada’s research, innovation and talent development in quantum science and technology through domestic and international collaborations.  Under the NQS, the Government of Canada has announced three new quantum-specific streams of Alliance grants:  •  Alliance – Quantum ($62.5 million over seven years) to reinforce, coordinate and scale up Canada’s domestic research capabilities;"
68,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,•  Alliance – Consortia Quantum ($40 million over seven years) to develop large-scale research collaborations across institutions that connect to government needs and industry applications; and
69,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,•  Alliance – International Quantum ($30 million over seven years) to allow Canadian academic researchers to connect to international opportunities.
70,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"As the mission road-mapping exercises advance, there will be an opportunity to further align the various streams with the needs of the quantum research community.  Working together to increase impact  In addition, many federal departments are already active in connecting and supporting the quantum community. For example, the NRC conducts and funds research in quantum. The Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Canadian Space Agency and DND are supporting and studying the development and impact of quantum technologies relevant to their respective mandates.  A new program, called the Quantum Research and Development Initiative (QRDI), will be introduced to grow Government of Canada quantum capabilities and expertise. The QRDI will help de-risk emerging quantum technologies for key sectors and advance applications to support government priorities. The program will bring together federal departments and agencies to work on collaborative quantum research and development projects, and engage with the broader Canadian quantum ecosystem in support of cross-cutting departmental mandates and priorities to address issues important to Canadians.  IDEaS  Innovation for Defence Excellence and Security (IDEaS) connects Canada’s toughest defence and security challenges with creative thinkers, providing them with the resources and guidance they need to bring new solutions to light. The program is intended to foster solutions at any stage of development that have a potential defence and security focus, and align them with DND/Canadian Armed Forces priorities. In addition to the program’s Quantum Leap Challenge, quantum technologies are regularly offered as solutions in other challenges to solve defence and security problems."
71,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Talent: Building a world-leading workforce  Developing, attracting and retaining talent are critical for Canada to succeed in quantum science and technology. The talent shortages already faced by industry and research institutions will intensify as more quantum technologies, products and services become available for broader use.  While research and technical talent is critical, growing Canada’s national ecosystem will also require efforts to build and retain a cross-disciplinary quantumliterate workforce from diverse backgrounds. This includes business and marketing talent that can support sector growth, and university and collegetrained talent that can apply quantum technologies across the economy. There is also a need to develop complementary social science and humanitiesrelated skills to ensure that the advantages arising from the use of quantum technologies can benefit all Canadians in a fair and equitable way. Amid a growing international demand for a limited pool of talent, Canada faces the particular challenges of retaining the talent it has developed and building a more diverse and inclusive quantum workforce.  Actions to date  Canada’s quantum talent is being sought the world over. Canadian universities have taken the lead in developing talent and attracting global researchers at the doctorate, postdoctorate and professor levels. Recognizing the importance of all levels of quantum talent on industrial success, universities have bolstered efforts to develop the talent pipeline by equipping students with industry-relevant quantum competencies at an earlier stage.  For example, the Université de Sherbrooke has launched a Bachelor in Quantum Science program to develop students early in their careers. The Institute for Quantum Computing has launched a new Master of Science in Physics with a specialization in Quantum Technology to arm students with the skills to drive the deployment of quantum technologies. To expand quantum computer-related training, the Institut Quantique and the Stewart Blusson Quantum Matter Institute have jointly launched the first Pan-Canadian virtual workshop in quantum programming.  Other investments have supported quantum talent development and knowledge mobilization. For example, in 2019–20, the Government of Canada supported talent mobilization in the quantum sector via more than $3 million in Mitacs internships.  NSERC CREATE has also been successfully used to build quantum talent by supporting training experiences relevant to academic and non-academic careers. Four quantum-focused CREATE initiatives funded from 2010 to 2018 collectively supported 306 trainees.  Research funding is also critical to training, as the majority of research funding goes to support the efforts of research trainees at the undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral levels. Larger-scale research awards also contribute to the attraction and development of quantum talent.  The way forward  Attracting and developing talent  Given the global competition for quantum talent, it will be critical for Canada to invest in developing and retaining quantum expertise in Canada, as well as accessing global pools of talent to meet Canada’s current and future needs. With respect to domestic talent, being internationally competitive on student and postdoctoral compensation and on the quality of their work environment will be key. In terms of international talent, Canada must make it as easy as possible to bring and keep those with quantum expertise here, to work with our researchers and businesses. Canada also has a role to play in collaboration with our international partners in ensuring an inclusive work environment and growing the overall global talent pool for our mutual benefit.  To provide the talent businesses and academia need to be successful, the Government of Canada will seek to generate new industry-ready quantum expertise by facilitating training and work-integrated learning opportunities on quantum projects for postsecondary students at the college, undergraduate and graduate levels, including postdoctoral fellows and other research talent. This will include supporting innovative research projects that provide students with exposure to business-related skills development (e.g., commercialization, entrepreneurship, project management, intellectual property) as well as social science considerations (e.g., legality, ethical use).  Academic research projects train and develop the quantum experts of tomorrow. Multiple disciplines can also play a critical role by helping analyze and manage risk (e.g., economics, finance management, political science). Colleges can play a role in developing many of the supporting skills required to advance quantum technologies and support their adoption by industry users. As the technologies mature and the capabilities are better understood, it will be important to develop expertise on the ethical use of quantum technologies.  Sustaining industry growth requires creating linkages to international pools of talent. The Government of Canada will support strategic partnerships that bring the best and brightest researchers and innovators from abroad, and enable Canadian talent to gain complementary skills from international partners in collaborations with like-minded nations.  Building on efforts to date, the NQS will strengthen Canada’s talent pipeline by bolstering programming delivered by Mitacs and NSERC CREATE. The government announced funding, including support to the NSERC CREATE grants in March 2022, which will allow the development of academic quantum expertise in areas of industry priority. Funding to Mitacs will help industry meet its talent needs by providing internships.  Under the NQS, the Government of Canada is providing $40 million over six years to Mitacs to support the attraction, training, retention and deployment of highly qualified personnel in quantum science and technology through internship experiences and professional skills development for post-secondary students, recent graduates and postdoctoral fellows. Industry internships will help transition talent to industry and retain expertise in Canada. Internships can also serve as powerful tools to attract international trainees to Canada. For example, Mitacs Accelerate International supports bilateral research collaborations between interns, universities and industry partners in Canada and abroad, allowing trainees from partner countries to undertake projects in Canada."
72,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"The Government of Canada is also providing $5.4 million over six years to NSERC CREATE toward developing research skills; training in areas such as professional skills, communication and collaboration; and mentoring activities for trainees. These initiatives will involve a group of accomplished researchers who work collaboratively to offer a defined research training program to trainees in areas aligned with NQS priorities.  Stakeholders stressed the importance of linkages to international pools of talent to complement Canadian strengths. Alliance International grants will enable academic Canadian researchers to work with international trainees to further academic-led projects. Additionally, several federal departments, including Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and Global Affairs Canada (GAC), are working to attract quantum talent to Canada by including quantum expertise in the list of desired qualifications.  Beyond the NQS, other Government of Canada funding has the opportunity to support research related to quantum technologies. For instance, Budget 2022 proposed $17.7 million over five years, starting in 2022–23, and $5.5 million thereafter until 2031–32, for the CSE to establish a unique research chair program to fund academics to conduct research on cutting-edge technologies relevant to CSE’s activities such as quantum technologies and AI.  Improving diversity in the talent pool  To ensure Canada benefits from the perspectives of a diverse pool of talent, it is critical to make diversity and inclusion hallmarks of talent efforts under the NQS. Representation in key fields relevant to the quantum sector is currently imbalanced, so Canada is missing out on a critical supply of new ideas and talent in a highly competitive international market. The NQS provides an opportunity to make a concerted effort to build an inclusive talent ecosystem in an area of national priority, by testing new approaches to attracting diverse talent to the field, supporting under-represented groups at all career stages and addressing systemic bias in the selection of talent for the quantum workforce.  The Government of Canada commits to fostering the full spectrum of ways it can address representation imbalances and support the people and communities who will advance quantum science and technologies. As approaches are being considered, NQS programs will pursue incremental gains in representation by implementing gender-based analysis approaches to equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI). Given current realities and a highly competitive international market for talent, sustained effort over time will be required to realize meaningful progress and will be a key consideration in the development of roadmaps under the NQS missions.  At the early stages of the talent pipeline, initiatives include Let’s Talk Science, a program to promote youth skills development and engagement in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Since 2015, Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada (ISED) has provided $22.5 million to enable the organization to deliver STEMbased programming for early years to grade 12 youth, build career awareness among students and teachers, and offer career-building volunteer opportunities to post-secondary students. These types of activities will be essential to growing expertise in quantum technologies among people of all communities, and establishing a pipeline to supply the research and businesses sectors.  Additionally, the program’s broad community-based approach encourages youth from under-represented groups, such as girls, Indigenous youth, youth with disabilities, at-risk youth, and those in rural or remote locations, to develop life-long learning habits and curiosity toward STEM fields such as quantum science and technologies.  NSERC, through the Tri-Agency EDI Action Plan, aims to support equitable access to funding opportunities for all researchers and students. For example, Alliance and CREATE funding opportunities require grantees to report on practices that support EDI. Alliance grants also include EDI as an integral consideration in the assessment of applications.  The Perimeter Institute’s initiatives to enhance EDI in theoretical physics and related fields include the Perimeter Scholars International Masters program and the International Summer School for Young Physicists, which have trained nearly equal numbers of participants across genders. To attract and retain more students, Perimeter is also launching the PSI START program, which aims to increase the numbers of undergraduate students from under-represented groups who pursue further studies in physics. The program will offer online schooling, as well as opportunities for a select number of trainees to participate in research with scientists at Perimeter."
73,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Commercialization: Translating research into commercial outcomes  Driven by the development of new technologies that promise economic and societal benefits, many nations around the world are pursuing the commercial development of quantum technologies. Canada has been an early mover, leading to many quantum firsts, and Canadian quantum entrepreneurs are wellpositioned to take advantage of the opportunities.  Canada has a growing ecosystem of start-ups, service providers, and larger domestic and multinational firms. A recent Statistics Canada analysis of 50 quantum companies between 2016 and 2019 shows healthy growth, with an increase in the number of companies (+58%), an increase in average sales (+30%) and an increase in employment numbers (+59%).7 Canadian businesses are also beginning to coordinate their activities by establishing industry associations such as Quantum Industry Canada. The technology mentoring program Creative Destruction Lab has spurred growth in the quantum sector by helping launch more than 50 quantum firms through its four quantum streams.  With large multi-nationals in the marketplace, Canadian companies need more resources to compete effectively. In addition to addressing challenges in securing investment, the sector needs to scale by identifying Canadian first adopters of its products and growing connections to international supply chains. Canadian firms and governments that could benefit from adopting new quantum innovations need to play a more active role in working with the quantum sector to drive product development. This will enhance their own ability to succeed in a more competitive and technologicallyenabled global environment."
74,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"The Government of Canada is committed to making quantum a Canadian scale-up success story by continuing to support growth as the industry expands and global competition for investment becomes fiercer.  Actions to date  The Government of Canada has supported the incubation, start-up and scale-up of leading quantum businesses of all sizes. For example, the NRC’s Industrial Research Assistance Program (IRAP) has provided funding and business supports for Canadian quantum small and medium-sized enterprises. Quantum technology firms have also received Government of Canada funding through ISC and regional development agencies such as the Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario (FedDev Ontario), Western Economic Diversification (WD) and Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions (CED). Additionally, GAC’s Canadian International Innovation Program, in partnership with NRC IRAP, has delivered funding to Canadian small and medium-sized enterprises to undertake collaborative R&D and technology matchmaking missions with foreign industrial partners in the quantum space.  In addition, the Government of Canada has supported large projects and national innovation ecosystems through the SIF, including a $40-million contribution to Vancouver-based D-Wave in March 2021. To meet the industry’s risk capital needs for a number of disruptive technologies—including quantum— the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC) launched the $200 million Deep Tech Venture Fund with investments in Xanadu of Toronto and Nord Quantique in Sherbrooke in 2022. BDC is a strong supporter of quantum start-ups, having engaged and supported many across the country. BDC was also an early investor in D-Wave.  The Government of Canada also funds commercial projects that support strategic priorities such as defence and security. For example, the DND’s IDEaS program supported innovators with $8.2 million to develop field-deployable quantum sensing technologies.  The way forward  To support R&D, scale up firms and drive the adoption of commercial applications, the Government of Canada will accelerate the development, prototyping and testing of strategic quantum products and services to bring them to market quicker, and support innovative firms to help them grow in Canada and globally. The Government of Canada will also develop and de-risk the market for quantum technologies through the procurement of new quantum products, processes and services that deliver on key government priorities. This will facilitate the adoption of these technologies by the public and private sectors.  The quantum business community has had success in securing support under a range of federal programs, such as SIF, BDC Deep Tech Venture Fund, IDEaS programs and others, and these programs could make additional investments in quantum. The way forward may also include support from the innovation and investment agency announced in Budget 2022. This agency will work with new and established Canadian industries and businesses to help them make the investments they need to innovate, grow, create jobs and be competitive in the changing global economy. Moving forward in the development of the NQS missions, near-, medium- and long-term needs of the quantum industry will be identified, and ways to adjust programming and respond to needs over time will be advanced.  Bringing new quantum technologies to market  Under the NQS, the Government of Canada will provide $50 million over seven years to expand the NRC’s Internet of Things: Quantum Sensors Challenge and launch its Applied Quantum Computing Challenge to:  •  Enable the development of revolutionary sensors that harness the extreme sensitivity of quantum systems to provide enhanced precision, sensitivity, rates and range of measurable phenomena; and"

76,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"algorithms, hardware and applications that harness the power of quantum computers.  Supporting Canadian firms and connecting them together  Through the Regional Economic Growth through Innovation (REGI) program, CED, FedDev Ontario, PrairiesCan and PacifiCan will deliver $70 million over seven years in quantum funding. REGI will support high-potential projects and commercialization activities to help scale up Canadian companies of any size involved in quantum and quantum-related technologies in key regional quantum hubs across Canada: Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. In June 2022, FedDev Ontario launched a funding call to support eligible businesses in southern Ontario to advance and commercialize their quantum products and solutions for domestic and global markets.  Under the NQS, the Government of Canada will provide $14 million over seven years to the Global Innovation Clusters to speed up growth in Canada’s quantum technologies industry by encouraging industry leaders, small and medium-sized enterprises, and post-secondary institutions to collaborate on large-scale quantum projects.  Creating a domestic market for quantum innovations  ISC enables the Government of Canada to use its R&D procurement spending (contracts) and grants to support the growth and scale-up of firms. Under the NQS, the Government of Canada will provide $35 million over seven years to assist innovative Canadian businesses solve pressing challenges by facilitating operational-prototype testing of late-stage R&D.  The Department of National Defence and Canadian Armed Forces Quantum Science and Technology (S&T) Strategy will advance defence interests by transitioning quantum technologies into capabilities. The S&T Strategy will achieve this by advancing research and engineering, building domestic and international partnerships, and growing the Canadian talent pool.  The Government of Canada will play a pivotal role in Canada’s quantum future by advancing the needs of the country; partnering with Canadian quantum companies to co-develop solutions; and making strategic use of policy, programming and procurement. The result will be a win-win partnership: Canadians will benefit from quantum applications while Canadian quantum companies will supply the world with sought-after solutions."
77,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"T o achieve the objectives of the NQS, the  Government of Canada needs to establish  mechanisms to tap into thought leadership and engage representatives along the entire innovation continuum—from researchers and companies to end users and government, including policy makers. Coordinated governance will position Canada to take advantage of research and commercial opportunities and increase awareness and adoption.  To help grow the quantum sector and ensure that the NQS remains on track, a Quantum Advisory Council will be established to provide impartial advice to government. The Council will draw on expertise, experience and knowledge of best practices from the industry, academic, not-for-profit and investment communities, as well as receptor industries. The Council could include representation from associations such as Quantum Industry Canada, as it will be important to engage the developer and user communities when identifying the needs of Canadian businesses.  Ongoing stakeholder engagement will be critical to achieving the goals of each of the three NQS missions. Mission-specific working groups representing the full innovation continuum will develop roadmaps including activities, milestones and potential investments. The Government of Canada will use the roadmaps to inform future quantum investments.  For the NQS to succeed, the quantum efforts of federal departments and agencies must be better coordinated and aligned. An interdepartmental Quantum Committee involving all federal departments with an interest in quantum will ensure coordination and connections to the broader Canadian quantum ecosystem. The NQS Secretariat will support these groups to facilitate the implementation of external advice and identify needs, opportunities, activities and programming.  The NQS Secretariat will also provide a focal point of contact, internal and external, to connect the ecosystem, providing information on opportunities and sources of support, and facilitating the adoption of quantum technologies by bringing together the user community and developing use cases in key sectors."
78,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Provincial and international collaboration  M utually beneficial collaboration will be  critical to the success of the NQS,  including among domestic businesses  and researchers, within federal departments, with  provincial governments, and between Canadian  stakeholders and international partners.  Several provincial governments (Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia) have identified quantum as a priority in their science and research agendas, and provided funding to the quantum hubs in their provinces:  • The Government of Quebec has invested heavily in quantum technologies, committing nearly $200 million in R&D for quantum projects from 2019 to 2026, including $131 million for the creation of a Sherbrooke Quantum Innovation Zone centred at the Institut Quantique de Sherbrooke. These investments also include $87.5 million for access to state-of-the-art quantum computing infrastructure, including a quantum computing hub at the Institut Quantique (IBM Quantum Hub), an IBM discovery accelerator, a quantum computer from IBM Q System One, located in Quebec, as well as a quantum computer from Anyon Systems for public research. In addition, Quebec has funded Canada’s first quantum communications loop, which will be located in the Sherbrooke Quantum Innovation Zone, and has invested more than $8 million in quantum innovation projects of startups and SMEs.  •  In 2021, the Government of Ontario announced an investment of $24 million over two years to the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics, which has received nearly $137 million in provincial funding since it was founded in 1999. Between 2014 and 2018, the province funded the Institute for Quantum Computing with close to $25 million, making Waterloo a global centre for development and commercialization of quantum technologies."
79,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"•  Since 2016, the Government of Alberta has invested $22 million in quantum-based university R&D, of which $6.1 million was to establish Alberta as a hub for quantum technologies in Canada. Recently, the province announced that $67.5 million in funding will be provided over three years through the implementation of the Alberta Technology and Innovation Strategy to accelerate commercialization of technologies in artificial intelligence and quantum science. This includes funding to establish Quantum City, a world-class quantum science and technology hub at the University of Calgary in a strategic partnership with the University of Alberta and the University of Lethbridge."
80,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"•  In 2019, the Government of British Columbia committed $17 million over five years to establish the Quantum Algorithms Institute."
81,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"Under the NQS, the Government of Canada will seek out collaboration opportunities with all provinces and territories, and provide funding to expand activities and partnerships. The NQS will align Canada’s efforts to build quantum capabilities across the country.  Linkages to the international community are crucial to success. Canadian researchers are actively working with international colleagues to create new knowledge, push the boundaries of understanding and develop new technologies that will serve our common interest. Canada is a leader in both the number and the quality of quantum publications with impacts among G20 countries.8 Almost 70% of Canadian quantum publications are produced in collaboration with international partners.  Canadian Institute for Advanced Research  CIFAR is a Canadian-based global research  organization that brings together international,  interdisciplinary researchers who work together  for five-year terms. Two major quantum  projects were renewed in 2019: quantum  materials and quantum information science.  Despite Canada’s considerable strength in quantum research and technology, the reality is that no single country can succeed in realizing a quantumenabled future by going it alone. Progress on key areas of quantum research will require deepening collaborations with international centres of expertise. Rather than simply competing for a small global talent supply, Canada must work with key partners to increase and diversify the collective talent pool.   International collaboration is also critical to ensure the Canadian quantum industry has strong connections to the global pool of ideas and to key international markets. In developing a more deliberate Canadian approach to international collaboration on quantum science, technology and innovation, it will be important to strike the right balance between open collaboration and Canada’s security interests, with a focus on working closely with trusted allies.  Because of existing connections with the international quantum community, Canada is able to work with partners to accelerate the development of mutually beneficial key technologies. The Government of Canada is pursuing opportunities to work with like-minded nations to deepen collaboration and opportunities.  For example, the NSERC-UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Quantum Technologies Competition brings together business, academic and government partners to develop quantum technologies. The first formal partnership between NSERC and the U.S. National Science Foundation, announced in June 2021, paves the way for research collaborations on emerging technologies, including quantum. NSERC and the European Commission, under the banner of Horizon Europe, are also partnering on quantum technologies. The Government of Canada continues to support international collaboration and launched an international quantum stream of the NSERC Alliance grants program.  Going forward, the Government of Canada commits to strengthening country-to-country collaboration bilaterally and multilaterally, with a focus on key allies. Along with jointly advancing knowledge, this approach will position Canada to ensure interoperability of these technologies and contribute to emerging supply chains in areas of sensitive technologies as well as quantum technologies more broadly.  When it comes to the development of sensitive technologies, it will be important to consider both the benefits and the risks of sharing knowledge. Threats posed by foreign interference and espionage are a challenge for Canada’s research community. Cuttingedge research and intellectual property in emerging domains, including quantum, can be an attractive target. It is important that research security measures be applied to prevent unauthorized use of and access to knowledge, data and results. Insufficient protections can allow hostile threat actors to exploit Canadian innovation, which may result in negative effects on the safety and security of Canadians, as well as missed opportunities to put Canada’s innovations into action and grow the economy."
82,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"To help protect Canada’s quantum research, initiatives under the NQS will take into account national security considerations to ensure Canada’s investments in quantum are maximized for Canadian benefit. These initiatives will follow Canada’s new National Security Guidelines for Research Partnerships, announced in July 2021, and the Guidelines on the National Security Review of Investments, announced in March 2021. Resources such as the Safeguarding Your Research Portal and the Safeguarding Science Initiative will also be used to inform researchers about the threat environment and offer tools to help them recognize and mitigate specific risks.  To maximize opportunities to work with international partners, the Government of Canada will seek to:  • Develop a talent pipeline to attract quantum expertise to Canada and help grow the global quantum community;  •  Augment skills of the Canadian quantum workforce;"

85,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"To strengthen the talent pipeline, the Government of Canada will work with Mitacs to facilitate integrated work placements for foreign experts in Canadian industry. As well, GAC’s Trade Commissioner Service (TCS) will be leveraged to facilitate Canadian firms’ access to foreign markets and help them export their products abroad.  Additionally, the TCS, in partnership with Invest in Canada, will support the NQS through the Foreign Direct Investment Attraction Strategy by promoting foreign direct investments from and R&D partnerships with like-minded countries, while keeping security implications in mind.  The TCS and Canada’s network of missions abroad can also support the NQS through Canadian International Innovation Program investments and by facilitating international partnerships and activities in line with NQS objectives. Going forward, international marketing opportunities will also be considered."
86,1,CAN,2022,Canada's National Quantum Strategy,"T his strategy is another step toward success  in quantum. Over the coming months, the  Government of Canada will launch additional funding calls and consider other supports in general industrial and research support programs. The quantum community is encouraged to continue to make use of related programming to bolster the development of quantum technologies.  Funding alone is insufficient. The surest way to succeed in the quantum technologies race is to work together. It is essential to co-develop roadmaps and milestones, along with ways to accurately report on progress, allowing Canada to be nimble in the rapidly evolving quantum technologies landscape. After the working groups develop roadmaps and milestones for each mission, the Government of Canada will be better positioned to take informed next steps toward strengthening Canada’s quantum ecosystem.  That is why the Government of Canada will continue its ongoing dialogue with stakeholders, provinces and like-minded nations, and deepen its collaborations to ensure that all elements are in place for success."

Exploiting the potential of quantum technologies for Germany New technologies have a huge impact on our everyday lives: they form the basis for a wide range of possibilities within the digital world, the foundation for the effective generation of energy, new forms of mobility and innovative medical technology. For a future-proof and technologically sovereign Germany, it is crucial to identify upcoming technologies and their potential as early as possible, to create excellent framework conditions for their future design and use, and to actively shape technology leaps. Quantum technologies are a future technology that have the potential to disrupt and offer particularly promising prospects for use. Although they are still at a comparatively early development stage, innovative uses within the economy and society are already emerging, which also address the challenges noted above.  The time horizon as well as the expected impact of the various key technologies involved in quantum technologies are different:1 with regard to enabling technologies and core components for quantum technologies, there is already a corporate landscape of start-ups and large companies within Germany. The first products related to quantum sensor technology, quantum materials and quantum communication have also reached market maturity. In contrast, quantum computing is only expected to be widely used in the medium to long term, although it does offer enormous development potential.2, 3 Like any other new technology, quantum technologies not only provide opportunities but also challenges, and it is important to keep track of them. For example, quantum computers will be powerful enough in the long term to threaten the security of traditional digital communications with the cryptography that is used today. The migration to cryptographic procedures that are resistant to quantum computing is therefore inevitable and is something that already needs to be under consideration.4 Germany is in a good position in terms of quantum technologies. Because of its proven research landscape, Germany ranks fourth behind the USA, China and Great Britain in terms of relevant publications when looking at things on an international scale and it has the most publications of any European country.5 Germany is also in the top four for patent families, behind China, the USA and Japan. The focus of German patent families is on quantum measurement technology and quantum electronics.6 It is important to make use of this strong foundation.  Against this backdrop the Federal Government’s goal is to move Germany and Europe into a leading international position in quantum technologies through targeted, long-term support and then to further consolidate this position. In terms of quantum computing, the aim is to catch up with the technology leaders. This ensures technological sovereignty, increases value creation potential and opens up great opportunities for the use of technology in the economy and society.  This is why the application-oriented development of quantum technologies in Germany must be advanced in a targeted manner. This encompasses: ∙ securing and expanding Germany’s innovativestrength and technological sovereignty in quantumtechnologies;"

8,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A Q.ANT employee shows a wafer from which photonic chips are cut. A young woman adjusts a non-linear optical system. Central to this is the establishment of an efficient ecosystem in which all relevant actors along the value chain work together in a tightly interconnected manner. The dovetailing of fundamental and applied research and the early involvement of end users will ensure that the technology develops in line with actual requirements. The integration of partners from the business community is an important building block in this respect. Furthermore, active positioning with regard to the development of standards and the development of required quantum metrology are also of great importance. The aim is to in this way tap into the expected enormous market potential in the area of application.7 The consequences for cyber security, and therefore for the digitalisation of Germany, that arise from the development of quantum technologies must also be considered at an early stage. With this conceptual framework programme the Federal Government is providing itself with a political framework until 2026 for measures to be taken in the field of quantum technologies. At the same time the concept forms part of a long-term strategy. This is because in order to fully utilise the potential of quantum technologies, additional stages beyond the conceptual framework programme will have to be created (see also Vision 2036 in Section 3). The federal ministries are responsible for implementing the individual components of the Federal Government’s interministerial conceptual framework programme. They will check the success of the respective measures against measurable targets and milestones. These indicators are continuously monitored, reviewed and successively updated at the level of measures and conceptual framework programme concepts, thereby allowing dynamic developments in quantum technologies to be taken into account.  In order to address the key challenges, the Federal Government is pursuing three central areas of focus. These primarily rely on public co-financing with the aim of triggering, strengthening and accelerating private initiatives and investments in Germany. Depending on the area of application, this takes different forms, for example, through contracts, direct project funding or shares in associated companies (especially venture capital).

27,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A young man in a laboratory adjusts the optics on a device. 2.Huge challenges, extraordinary potential Quantum technologies, i.e., the targeted control of quantum mechanical effects and their technological exploitation, promise enormous progress for applications in the economy, society and governmental institutions. Depending on the type of technology (quantum computing and quantum simulation, quantum communication and post-quantum cryptography, quantum sensor technology and quantum metrology, as well as the associated enabling technologies), the application maturity and its possible uses vary. Quantum computing and  quantum simulation The enormous potential is most evident in quantum computing. Traditional computers will reach their limits in the long term, for example, in the simulation of chemical reactions and compounds (material sciences, drug design) or the optimisation of complex systems, such as logistical systems. Through new algorithms based on qubits (quantum bits) instead of traditional bits, a quantum computer could deliver clear advantages in this respect. There is also potential, for example, in forecasting weather services and the modelling of climate change and its consequences.  Research has therefore been undertaken into a plethora of technologically different implementations of quantum computers (see also ‘Quantum computing’ info box) and possible use cases. It is not possible, however, to reliably predict which of these approaches will ultimately be successful or whether different implementations will excel in particular use cases. However, the technologies have the potential to create completely new possibilities for products and services in a wide range of application areas and industries, thereby having a significant impact on international competition. In the long term studies are working on the basis of an annual market volume of several hundred billion euros in quantum computing alone.9 This explains the high level of attention being paid and the considerable financial commitment to the issue worldwide. Nevertheless, fundamental challenges still need to be overcome in the development of both hardware and software, which require long-term research and development activities.  A laser beam that passes through several lenses arranged one after the other. Post-quantum cryptography and  quantum communication Even though it is not a quantum technology itself, post-quantum cryptography plays an important role in this context. From the IT security point of view, the development of powerful quantum computers poses a threat: the so-called Shor algorithm, a quantum information technology method, would be able to break the public key cryptography that is in use today. The quantum computing hardware that is required does not yet exist. However, as soon as this is available, it would pose an incalculable risk since encryption methods such as this are currently used to secure confidential communications and security-relevant data. Even today, encrypted data can be hacked into and recorded so that it can be decrypted later with future quantum computers (‘store now, decrypt later’). This makes it imperative to develop and introduce new, quantum-safe cryptographic procedures (‘post-quantum cryptography’), which should offer a level of security against quantum computers at least as high as the aforementioned traditional procedures do today. It should be noted that post-quantum cryptography can be implemented on traditional hardware in the same way as the public key methods currently in use. This distinguishes it significantly from quantum communication methods and allows it to even be used in situations where quantum communication is not possible, for example, due to physical limitations. Quantum communication offers enormous potential to secure confidential communication in a highly effective manner. In terms of quantum encryption, quantum physical effects such as entanglement or the fact that it is impossible to create perfect identical copies of individual photon are used for key exchange in order to transmit data securely. Unlike common cryptographic methods, the high level of security"
28,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"involved in quantum cryptography is based on phys-ical laws of nature and not on mathematical assump-tions. A wide variety of quantum communication methods have since been demonstrated in use, both in optical fibres and between satellites, and in terrestrial free-space connections. For broad application rele-vance, however, it is the range and data rate that still pose a challenge. This is why it is essential to develop quantum repeaters, which are required as nodes to extend the communication-transmission paths, as a key component for quantum communication over long distances. Quantum sensor technology and quantum metrology Within the field of quantum technologies, quantum-based metrology is probably the field with the highest technological maturity. For example, nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond are already used in special microscopes. The first quantum gravimeters are also available on the market and enable the Earth’s gravitational field to be measured for applications in geology or geodesy.  Quantum sensors also offer new applications that complement traditional technologies. By directly referencing the measurement methods to natural constants, which are without uncertainties defined by the recent redefinition of the SI system of units (2019),10 they offer novel possibilities for reliable, ubiquitous and highly accurate sensor technology. Overall, quantum-based metrology is a heterogeneous field with a wide variety of technologies and numerous opportunities for promising applications, some of which are already ready for the market. However, quantum metrology is not limited to quantum sensor technology. It generally relates to performing high-resolution and highly sensitive measurements of physical parameters using quantum effects such as quantum entanglement. Quantum metrology therefore promises the development of measurement techniques that enable greater precision than undertaking the same measurements using traditional methods. For example, electrical quantum metrology can develop conventional metrology into comprehensive quantum metrology. Among other things, programmable ‘quantum voltmeters’ are already available on the market. Enabling technologies The cross-sectional field of enabling technologies is particularly indispensable when it comes to further developing quantum technologies. It is already demonstrating economic potential: the first markets for special lasers, control electronics and even cooling technology for quantum systems have already emerged. Highly specialised start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in particular can generate their first sales. The future challenge will be to develop innovative overall systems from this sum of individual components and to open up further possibilities of use. As a cross-sectional task it is necessary from the outset to consider and develop an independent metrological characterisation and qualification of components11 in order to achieve a stable, trustworthy and reliable value chain in the emerging quantum technology industry. This guarantees quality, comprehensible and firm performance parameters and the comparability of quantum technology components. A young man adjusts a QANT device. An international comparison of  the state of technologies Drawing comparisons on an international level, the USA currently leads the world, especially in terms of quantum computing. For example, major corporations such as Google and IBM currently represent the state of the art in superconducting quantum computing. The USA also has the highest number of start-ups in quantum technologies (92), the highest amount of venture capital introduced (USD 2.2 billion from 2001 to 2021) and the most academic research groups (64).12 National funding is distributed among a wide range of national agencies and organisations (including NIST, NASA, DARPA) with different thematic and strategic focuses. Total government funding in 2022 was approximately USD 0.9 billion.13 When drawing comparisons on an international scale, China has announced the highest level of government funding by far with a total of USD 15 billion. Specific structures and strategies are less transparent, but important work has already been published at a scientific and technological level. For example, an intercontinental key exchange was demonstrated in 2018 using quantum cryptographic methods and with the help of the Micius research satellite.14 With regard to quantum computing, there are also an increasing number of developments that indicate a high level of technology. In the European Union substantial public funding for quantum technologies has now been announced (USD 7.2 billion within the EU compared to USD 1.9 billion in the USA). In Germany, EUR 2 billion of this is available for research and development in quantum technologies alone within the framework of the Federal Government’s Future Package. In contrast, however, there is considerably less venture capital available, especially compared to the USA (USD 0.3 billion compared to USD 2.2 billion). In terms of scientific publications, the European Union is a leader, both when it comes to academic quality and academic breadth. The number of start-ups has also more than tripled since 2015,15, 16 but is far below the numbers in the USA. For Germany it is important to benefit economically and socially from the development of quantum technologies and to establish sovereign access to this technology of the future.

These are quantum mechanical systems that come in two states (0) and (1) or in a superposition of them due to the quantum physical effect of superposition. This means that qubits can assume any combination of the two states. In addition, two or more qubits can be ‘entangled’ with each other so that they assume a particular common overall state. A change in one qubit will therefore have immediate effects on the other entangled qubits, even if they are spatially separate from each other. This is a fundamentally different computing principle than that of traditional computers. Due to the enormous scaling with the number of qubits associated with this approach, quantum computers with only a few qubits are already expected to have enormous potential for certain computing operations. A quantum computer is defined not simply by the number of usable quantum bits (a measure of the size of the problem), but also by the error rates of an operation (it helps to estimate the quality of the result) and the depth of the implementable circuits (i.e., the computational sequences of the quantum operations on the qubits). Circuits with many operations in succession (‘great depth’) enable more complex calculations to be performed. The depth of the circuit depends, among other things, on how long certain physical states can be maintained ( ‘decoherence time’). Quantum computers are intrinsically parallel and suitable for huge task sizes, while traditional computers only achieve parallelism through many functional units working in parallel and are limited in the size of the problems they can process as a result of their memory. By using the quantum mechanical principles of entanglement and superposition, quantum computers are capable of handling certain tasks that push traditional computers to their limits. A quantum advantage can therefore be achieved with these tasks, for example, in the sense of massively reducing the computing time required, which in many cases makes a solution possible in the first place. Quantum computers should in general, and especially in the long-term, be regarded as special hardware for specific areas and not as a replacement for previous microelectronic computers for broad circles of users. The development of a practically-relevant quantum computer requires the generation and control of numerous qubits. These must not lose their quantum properties for the longest possible time due to interaction with the environment (known as decoherence), although at the same time it must be possible to prepare, entangle and read them out in a controlled manner. To this end a wide variety of physical realisations of architectures for qubits are being developed, from ion traps to electrons in semiconductor structures, superconducting systems to nuclear spins or photons and topological states. All technical implementations have their own set of advantages and disadvantages and it is not possible to predict which of the technological approaches will prevail. Complex further developments of hardware and algorithms are still needed to achieve a universally programmable computer. Since many quantum algorithms react very sensitively to disturbances, the ability to correct errors is also a decisive factor here. In addition to robust qubits, special algorithms are also being developed to improve the efficiency of the hardware. In contrast to a universal quantum computer, quantum simulators represent a controllable system that can be developed to tackle a specific problem. They are used to mimic another quantum system, thereby simulating specific processes. In this way quantum simulators can model practical properties, for example, in materials research. Quantum communication When it comes to quantum communication, quantum states form the basis for the secure transmission of information. In this context quantum states are used for key distribution in quantum cryptography. According to the ‘no-cloning theorem’, it is impossible to copy unknown quantum states or to measure them without interference. This is why, with regard to individual quanta and entangled quanta, it is possible to determine whether the information transported with them has already been read out. It is therefore possible to detect a possible eavesdropping attack on communications that were believed to be secure. Compared to previous encryption concepts, safety from interception of data transmission is not based on complexity assumptions of specific mathematical problems, but on quantum mechanical principles. Since quantum states are very fragile, a number of considerable technical challenges are linked to their transmission. For example, quantum signals must be maintained over long distances and fault conditions must be reduced. In order to be able to make use of the advantages provided by quantum communication, it must be qualitatively and quantitatively tested in existing IT and communication infrastructures before being gradually integrated. In order to maintain the reliability and availability of communication infrastructures, quantum systems also need to reach a level of maturity that corresponds to that of traditional IT systems. There are possible points of attack, such as the interfaces between quantum and traditional IT systems.  In order to achieve future interoperable applications, as well as a standardised understanding of the security of quantum communication, it is also necessary to standardise basic building blocks such as the protocols used, key management, the integration of quantum repeaters as nodes to extend communication distances, and other network elements. A floating particle trap: helium plasma in the vacuum chamber excites the particles to glow. Quantum sensor technology and quantum metrology Quantum states are very sensitive to influences from the surrounding environment. In quantum computing and quantum communication, this means that qubits are very difficult to control for a long enough period of time. But what poses a challenge in one context, can also translate into great advantages elsewhere. Nevertheless, it is precisely this level of sensitivity to external influences that can be used to undertake very precise measurements of underlying physical variables, for example, electric and magnetic fields, gravity or temperature. A fundamental idea behind quantum sensor technology is to use two states in a quantum system, whereupon the spectroscopic measurable energy difference of them depends on the magnitude of the external influence. Other measurement principles use wave properties of matter. With quantum optics, the entanglement of photons allows extremely precise measurements to be taken and enables imaging in spectral ranges that were previously inaccessible. Quantum-based measuring technology can result in a new level of precision that cannot be achieved using traditional measurement technologies. One challenge is to shield all environmental influences that could result in a false measurement.  Quantum metrology is closely linked to this: it uses quanta to define units of measurement and for other extremely precise research. Quantum mechanics sets the ultimate limit regarding the accuracy of any measurement. Quantum metrology therefore uses quantum effects to achieve a higher level of precision than that which is possible with traditional approaches, or to make measurements possible in the first place.  Quantum metrology, also as a result of SI units being redefined, further offers the possibility of drift-free, self-referenced quantum sensors that can be traced to the SI. These can offer significant advantages compared to traditional solutions, for example, when used as (pressure) sensors in process automation, or quantum electronic components that directly realise the newly defined SI units and quantities derived therefrom, such as the volt and the ampere."

They are both wearing safety goggles and are working on adjusting a device. 3.Top-level technology for creative power and technological sovereignty Quantum technologies are a future key emerging technology in which Germany is building a strong foundation. The Federal Government’s goal is to take advantage of the available opportunities and to establish Germany and Europe as world leaders in this field. Targeted measures will make quantum technologies usable for society and the economy while securing technological sovereignty. In this context, the Federal Government is guided by a long-term target image where an advanced state of technology and diverse applications will be established by 2036. Vision 2036 The development of quantum technologies from a future technology into a central key emerging technology requires a time horizon that clearly exceeds the time frame of this conceptual framework programme. The Federal Government is therefore relying on a ‘research and innovation’ approach – also encouraged by the Expert Commission on Research and Innovation17, 18 to further develop measures and a long-term, sustainable promotion and development of the technology. In the case of quantum computing, a technology-neutral approach is particularly important until it becomes clearer which realisation of qubits is most advantageous for the further development of quantum computers. It is also conceivable that different hardware platforms would be particularly suited to different applications. In the long term quantum technologies should be established as a key emerging technology in a wide range of application fields. By 2036, ten years after the end of this conceptual framework programme, our target image is:  ∙ Quantum technologies are core components in awide range of economic applications. They makesignificant contributions to value creation in Germany and to dealing with the pressing future issuesthat face our society, including: ∙ Quantum sensors are established in a wide rangeof economically and socially relevant applications.

59,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"The Federal Government’s measures are divided into three action pathways: A young woman looks through a microscope. A.Make quantum technologies usable for the economy, society and state institutions Quantum technologies will open up a wide range of new possibilities: from the simulation of new active substances to bug-proof communication and novel sensors that detect unexploded bombs or enable navigation without satellite support. Against this background a targeted development of the technology is needed, one that always takes account of possible application scenarios.  This conceptual framework programme of the Federal Government therefore focuses on measures that stimulate, strengthen or accelerate private investment in Germany through public co-financing. Depending on the area of application, public support takes different forms.  To this end the Federal Government uses three complementary and coordinated funding instruments:  ∙ In the case of research-related topics that are ofconsiderable federal interest, research and development in companies, universities and research institutions is supported with subsidies through projectfunding. These non-repayable grants are primarilyaimed at application-oriented project consortia thatcover the value chain from technology development to the end user."
60,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"∙ Through the targeted awarding of contracts formarketable products, the public sector acts as acentral anchor and reference customer for companies that develop and manufacture such hardwarein Germany.

Alongside theestablished High-Tech Gründerfonds (HTGF), theDTCF is an example of direct public-sector participation in venture capital."
62,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"In order to focus on the ambitious techno-economic goals of the conceptual framework programme for quantum technologies and to do justice to the budgetary priority of private funding over public funding, the funding measures also successively take into account the increasing degrees of technology maturity as part of their framework conditions.  The aim of the conceptual framework programme is to create a close network of actors who will establish the first products on the market in a timely manner by means of joint research and development. Germany can particularly benefit from a large number of potential users from many different sectors.21 The rapid and interlocking development of initial pilot applications as well as testbeds22 and standards will allow the technology to be tested in real use scenarios.  The Federal Government can see great potential in the following areas in particular: A laboratory with a coating system for ion beam coating. Economic innovative strength  The development of quantum technologies has now progressed to the point that they will enter into a growing number of areas of economic life in the coming years. Looking at it in the long term, the successful application of quantum technologies is associated with enormous market potential for German companies, which can use them to offer innovative products and services. In addition to the development and distribution of the technology, a wide range of new opportunities for application are opening up across all sectors, from product development to service offerings.  In the field of quantum sensor technology and communication, where the first products are already on the market, business can benefit both in sales and in the use of new technologies.  To this end the Federal Government will create the foundations for research and industry within the framework of this conceptual framework programme to  ∙ bring the first applications to market with lighthouse projects in quantum sensor technology, forexample, in the exploration of raw materials, thereconnaissance of construction ground or the useof highly accurate inertial positioning and navigation systems,"

According to studies the application could first be established in optimisation problems in industry and logistics (e. g., via quantum annealers), subsequently in the simulation of chemical processes, in AI-based evaluation of large amounts of data and later in quantum cryptography.23  Experts predict that the real value creation will not be in the development of the hardware, but rather in its application in the next wave of digitalisation,24 which will affect numerous industries. In the chemical and pharmaceutical industries in particular, significant economic potential can be identified, even at an early stage of development.25 For example, ammonia synthesis for the production of fertilisers and fine chemicals accounts for around one to three percent of global energy consumption and a corresponding process-related CO2 emission.26 Even an optimisation of just a few percentage points in efficiency level using improved catalysts developed with the help of quantum simulations would have a significant global impact on energy efficiency and climate protection.

70,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Societal challenges  Societies around the world are facing major challenges: Climate change is a global phenomenon. Tackling it and dealing with its consequences requires action on a common global, European, national, regional and local level. A better understanding of the Earth system, the individual components of the climate system and the main factors influencing the climate, as well as the need to adapt to the expected or already foreseeable consequences of climate change, will help to discover suitable, tailored solutions to meet the challenges. Due to diverse international interdependencies and limited resources, securing the supply of energy is also a global task that has to be addressed in the long term at international, national and local level, in addition to overcoming the current energy crisis.  The question of mobility is closely linked to these aspects. A globally networked society and economy are inconceivable without mobility. Mobility is the backbone for the provision of essential goods, a prerequisite for inclusion, access to work, education and health care. At the same time mobility is also fundamental to achieve equal opportunities between the sexes and for disadvantaged population groups. All economic sectors are also dependent on functioning transport and logistics; without these it would be impossible to do business and sell and distribute goods. In this respect there is also a double dependency on mobility and energy supply. Mobility therefore has a considerable influence on economic and social development. The current technology jumps have initiated a fundamental transformation of the mobility sector as well as the energy sector. When it comes to health, demographic change, increased levels of travel, infectious diseases, and illnesses resulting from changing lifestyles and diets as well as climate change, are all constantly posing new challenges to medical care. Quantum technologies can make important contributions in these thematic fields and sectors: Climate research: With new types of quantum sensor technology, the monitoring of climate changes can be significantly improved in the medium term (e. g., changes in water resources using gravimeters for earth observation). In the long term, quantum computing is also seen as having the potential to improve the situation in terms of simulating climate change. Energy supply: The energy supply of the future will be highly decentralised. In this respect distributed energy grids and local renewable energy providers as well as private households will work together in a complex system. The interplay of supply and demand is a complex optimisation problem that quantum annealers and future quantum computers could be particularly suited to solving. Mobility: Improved sensor technology opens up new possibilities in various areas of mobility, for example, through improvements in position stabilisation using quantum gyroscopes (used in autonomous driving in road traffic, through to space travel). In the long term, quantum computing can create new approaches for optimising traffic flows. Quantum technologies will make important contributions to hyper-connected, smart and autonomous mobility, which depends on security and stability in all its components and interactions, and is also based on real-time data exchange in rapidly increasing quantities. Health: The development of quantum sensors can provide access to improved or novel therapeutic and diagnostic options in medical technology in the short and medium term. New imaging techniques in particular will be of great importance in laboratory analysis or intraoperative diagnostics. In the long term, quantum sensors can be developed for controlling prostheses, for example. The development of drugs or vaccines can be accelerated and/or improved by using quantum computers.  Digitalisation and artificial intelligence: The development of system responses based on Big Data in areas such as personalised medicine, autonomous driving or control in urban infrastructure requires the use of rapid decision algorithms. These hugely benefit from quantum simulators and quantum algorithms and can be superior to traditional methods in terms of performance and accuracy.

Germany must master these technologies of the future in order to be able to act with sovereignty.

B.Drive forward targeted technologydevelopment with a view to futureapplication Pushing technological boundaries  Great progress has been made in quantum computing in recent years. Nevertheless, many development steps are still needed before application maturity can be reached with a universal error-corrected quantum computer. The Federal Government is therefore pursuing this goal with a long-term development strategy (see also ‘Quantum Computing Technology Lighthouse’ info box). This includes system development at all levels (‘full quantum computing stack’). In particular, novel approaches need to be found to scale quantum computing chips into universal computing units.  In quantum sensor technology and quantum communication, developments are already more advanced and closer to being used. Nevertheless, there is a need for further research and development in the improvement of technological parameters, measurement methods and readout protocols as well as in standardisation and certification. An additional focus is on improving the robustness, integrability, miniaturisation and applicability of the technologies.  To support the targeted further development of practicable systems, the Federal Government also supports research into enabling technologies, which are crucial as a basis for achieving further progress. This includes materials, components and manufacturing technologies, but also basic modules for the preparation, control, manipulation and detection of quantum states.

86,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Setting standards Issues surrounding standardisation and norms will play a crucial role in the future development, mastery and diffusion of the technology. In this way commercial enterprises can be supported by building up a quality infrastructure for quantum technologies; ‘made in Germany’ quantum technologies can therefore be used as a quality feature worldwide. International standardisation committees define the specifications of new technologies and thus have a decisive influence on their design and ultimately on access to the market. Against this backdrop a strong commitment is required at the technological forefront to the development of a metrological quality infrastructure and the intensified continuation of activities already under way in this area.27 , 28, 29 A roadmap of the CEN-CENELEC Quantum Technology Focus Group analyses the standardisation needs in this area and proposes a coherent framework that enables effective standardisation in all domains (computing, communication, sensing) and helps avoid duplication.  Specific examples form characterisation parameters for components for quantum communication or for ion traps for quantum computers, as well as initial approaches for quantum computer benchmarking. Based on this preliminary work, a Joint Technical Committee JTC 22 was recently set up at CEN-CENELEC, as requested by DIN. The increased number of international activities in the field of quantum technologies and related areas are already reflected in the first standard-setting activities.30, 31 In this context an important role is taken up by the development of suitable benchmarks and characterisations of quantum technology components so that quantitative comparisons of performance can be made across architectures and technologies, particularly in the field of quantum computing. Initial approaches are currently taking place at DIN.32 An independent qualification of components is also an important prerequisite for stable value chains and therefore for tapping economic potential. Furthermore, an infrastructure such as this helps to build trust in quantum technologies and prevents overblown expectations. Standardisation requires the companies involved to interact on an equal footing, to expect significant economic benefits from the results and to have sufficient financial and human resources to carry out intensive committee work. The influence of a particular economic area in the international standardisation bodies basically depends on the number and influence of such companies as these. Against this background the Federal Government, in cooperation with its European partners, will work towards greater German and European involvement in the standardisation bodies. By promoting an entrepreneurial ecosystem for quantum technologies, conditions for work on standardisation and norms are ultimately supported in a targeted manner. The need for standards that have already been identified in the first stages,33  e. g., for relevant parameters of quantum technology components for ‘reliable data sheets’, provide the basis for  harmonised and jointly developed characterisation and qualification at a European level, as well as the use of testbeds.34, 35 The Federal Government will therefore ∙ support standardisation activities in the field ofquantum technologies and work towards strongerGerman and European involvement in standardisation bodies,"

88,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A Q.ANT engineer prepares a photonic chip for the next step. Technology lighthouse: quantum computing  Compared to the other branches of quantum technologies, quantum computing is expected to have the highest potential for disruption in applications.36 At the same time the technology is still at a comparatively early stage. It is true that the first quantum computers are already capable of performing simple computing operations. However, these systems still have limited computing power, are error-prone and can only be used for special tasks. The full potential of the technology can only be realised when a universally programmable and error-corrected quantum computer is available and can be used alongside existing computer architectures. Numerous further development stages are necessary for this.37 Experts estimate that the necessary stages will take at least ten to fifteen years. Economically usable interim results in the areas of application can be expected before then, within the next five to fifteen years.38 In view of the technological uncertainties these time scales represent an initial rough estimate that accounts for forecasts from public institutions39 and industry40, 41, 42 and the pace of development to date. Today, cutting-edge technology is organised into global value chains. In technically demanding areas that require high levels of investment, the available economic resources can be a limiting factor that makes international cooperation necessary. At the same time the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian war of aggression in Ukraine have highlighted how fragile and vulnerable global supply chains can be and how the value of global technological sovereignty in an uncertain world has changed. The Federal Government will therefore support technology development in quantum computing in the long term. On the basis of the roadmap drawn up by an independent council of experts, the Federal Government is implementing an ambitious package of measures as part of the fiscal stimulus and future package, the aim of which is to achieve technological sovereignty for Germany and Europe in the field of quantum computing. This would mean that Germany, together with partners from the European Union, becomes technologically independent when it comes to the production of corresponding hardware and software. A central role in critical elements of international value chains for quantum computing can also ensure that Germany, as a key partner, can always maintain access to economically essential quantum resources. A balance must be struck between competition and cooperation.  In the short and medium term, the measures aim to develop the first quantum computers in Germany at the state-of-the-art in research and technology. They are to be scaled up and improved until they provide a quantum advantage in practical applications. This forms the basis of the development of a universal, error-corrected system. The Federal Government is relying on a technology-open approach in this respect, since it is not yet foreseeable which technological basis is best suited for the various areas of application and which can be scaled up. We regularly review which of the technology strands seems promising and adjust the portfolio of measures accordingly. As part of this conceptual framework programme the Federal Government aims to develop a quantum computer on a par with international developments and at least 100 individually controllable qubits by 2026, scalable to 500 qubits in the medium term. In addition, high-performance special hardware shall be developed for suitable fields of application. The work in hardware development is flanked by measures to develop software and algorithms for these new types of computers in order to be able to exploit speed and quality advantages. This is particularly important in view of the fact that experts regard the decisive potential for value creation to not be in hardware and software, but in the next wave of digitisation and therefore in the applications.43 In parallel, quantum simulators are being further developed. These can provide similar quantum benefits to quantum computers in several specific areas, for example, in materials research or in the improvement of chemical processes such as the energy-intensive production of fertilisers.44 Specifically, the Federal Government is pursuing the following measures for the development of quantum computers ‘made in Germany’: ∙ Competitive development of basic technology platforms for quantum computers.

This should enable the targeted and, by means of synergies, efficient development of quantum technologies that are economically self-sustaining in the long term. The Federal Government is strengthening the quantum technology ecosystem through the following means: ∙ Direct project funding from the Federal Government is generally directed at consortia fromindustry and science. Project consortia that coveras many parts of the value chain as possible arefunded. Through joint research and developmentwork, close ties are forged between fundamentalresearchers, developers and users, and ideas arepursued in a targeted manner. The developmentof characterisation, qualification and standardisation of quantum technology components withinvalue chains is considered from the beginning andincluded in the measures."
96,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"∙ At the same time the entrepreneurial ecosystemis stimulated by collocated research contracts:for example, innovative quantum computers areprocured for DLR’s own needs through researchcontracts. In the European partnership EuroHPC,which is co-financed by the Federal Government,quantum computers are also being procured for locations of the Gauss Centre for Supercomputing in Germany; albeit with a smaller financial volume. With this instrument, more mature approaches in technological terms will be developed in the medium term by companies, especially start-ups. For highly innovative companies from the European economic area, close cooperation with DLR also creates incentives to locate research, development and production in Germany."

103,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"A miniaturised vacuum chamber lies on a laboratory bench. Awaken interest, attract skilled workers Quantum technologies are still a comparatively abstract topic that requires explanation, with communication proving to be a major challenge. For a discussion of the technology and its applications, however, an approach is required that can be understood in general terms. In addition, there is a need for realistic expectations regarding the potential, the pace of development as well as the limits of the technology, especially among decision-makers from business and politics. Information that can be understood by all parties concerned and specific knowledge about applications of quantum technologies are therefore also needed in general and school education. Bottlenecks in recruiting suitable academic specialists are already becoming apparent today.49 Consequently, it is hugely important to look at ways in which information can be shared in a manner that is appropriate for the target group. The aim is to increase low-threshold interest in order to inspire the skilled workers of tomorrow, as well as to demonstrate potential to users from outside the field. Employees in companies must be empowered to use the technology. And it goes without saying that there is also a need for highly qualified professionals, especially with regard to developing the technology further. For this reason, the following needs to be done:  ∙ Showcasing of opportunities and possibilities fordifferent professional development paths,"
104,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"∙ Analysing the needs of developers and users ofquantum technologies in Germany within the context of an evidence-based education and researchpolicy, as well as relevant capacities in terms ofspecialist training so that the scope of the necessarymeasures can be estimated,"

107,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"The Federal Government has already put together a broad package of measures. Under the umbrella brand Quantum Future,50 various measures are being put in place to build up a skilled labour base: young researchers can establish their first small working group, training and further education concepts are actioned, younger students become enthused about the topic within the framework of an academy and an award ceremony. Intuitive and participatory outreach concepts for quantum technologies are also intended to address broader segments of the population.  Within the framework of this conceptual framework programme these measures will be developed further alongside new ideas for knowledge transfer and the participation of civil society. The biggest challenge in the future will be to address and reach the different target groups. Only then will there be enough skilled workers for tomorrow, the right decisions will be made in dealing with the issue and the topic will become accepted on a social level.  One focus of the activities will be on increased support for excellent young personnel. This will begin with the networking of outstanding students and specific support for doctoral students, and will move on to targeted measures such as Quantum Fellowships or academic junior research groups for outstanding postgraduates who are urgently needed for technology development in particular. In addition, specific attention will be paid to young people who can provide the next generation of skilled workers in the emerging quantum technology market. To this end age-appropriate ways of sharing research-based learning that will encourage people to act upon it are being developed, for example, through participatory actions in schools.  At the same time the further training of experienced professionals and technical staff from thematically related fields should be encouraged since this area is seen as being able to offer particularly good prospects for broadening the skilled labour base.51  A young man fills liquid nitrogen into a cryostat to cool it. The cryostat contains a 3D vector magnet that can be used to magnetically analyse samples. Keeping an eye on impact: identifying opportunities and considering effects To build a technology of the future, new developments must be recognised at an early stage and strategically taken into account. The Federal Government bases its measures on the results of broad-based agenda and strategy processes involving experts from science and industry.52, 53 In addition, the positions of expert commissions,54 academies55 and associations56, 57 are also taken into account.  Due to the rapid development of the technology, the Federal Government is also in constant dialogue with the professional sector in order to be able to take new developments into account at an early stage. For this purpose, the opinion of expert committees with external expertise is sought, partly through fixed advisory groups and partly through expert discussions on specific topic areas. In addition, a systematic, ongoing monitoring of the ecosystem will be set up as part of the accompanying research. At the same time the buy-in of citizens regarding the acceptance of new quantum technologies must take place alongside technology development. Direct and early cooperation between researchers and later users within the framework of participatory technology development will promote practical and needs-oriented technical solutions. From coming into direct contact with new quantum technologies in medicine, mobility and communication, to questions of resilience and internal and external security, citizens and the economy, the state and society will be impacted in many ways by these new developments. So far, the discussion has focused on the opportunities and options provided by the technology. The risks that are currently most frequently under discussion come in the form of which development gaps exist compared to competing countries. However, as technologies mature and are applied, questions will increasingly be asked about societal and cultural influences, technology assessment and the prevention of adverse side effects.  In addition to overall societal issues looking at social effects through the impact on everyday life and the world of work, discussions in the field of innovation management, for example, will focus on the impact of access to quantum technologies (e. g., through small and medium-sized enterprises), what effect quantum technologies have on individual industries and supply chains or on national security provision, and what specific innovations they introduce.  Last but not least quantum technologies will have a considerable influence on modern cryptography. As soon as powerful quantum computers become available, the security of cryptography methods used as standard today will no longer be guaranteed. Quantum communication can solve this problem through quantum-based key agreement.58 In combination with post-quantum cryptography based on mathematical principles, the confidentiality of sensitive information can be maintained in the long term. However, the new risks posed by technology, especially for information security and data protection, need to be evaluated, tracked alongside evolving technology, and effective countermeasures need to be designed. Overall, it is important to keep an eye on any such consequences at an early stage in order to counteract potentially undesirable developments promptly and in order to hold an open discussion with the social actors."

The aim is to avoid duplication of work, to define interfaces as well as handover points and to bring together development strands beyond the respective areas of responsibility of the ministries.  The activities of the ministries are considered together from the outset and regularly coordinated at a management and working level. The central committee at the working level is a ministerial group in which all thematically involved ministries work together on current developments and planned measures. In addition, within the framework of project funding, activities are coordinated jointly and at an early stage in order to create synergies. This includes joint, inter-ministerial activities to strengthen ecosystems and networking between different funded actors."

Close networking of the Federal Government with the specific measures and priorities of the federal states is ensured by regular coordination meetings at working level. In addition, significant momentum can also result from close contact with academies and associations. Build strong international partnerships and secure technological sovereignty The Federal Government’s goal is to ensure sovereignty in terms of access to all the relevant building blocks of this future technology. This goal is pursued by holistically promoting an entrepreneurial quantum technology ecosystem and helping to shape its development and application by providing an equal footing and ensuring it remains in line with our values. In doing so the German government is relying on a strategic European approach with the political goal of technological sovereignty.59 European actions dedicated to quantum technologies have been collated at European level since 2018, mainly through the Quantum Flagship, which was supplemented, for example, by European funding for metrological aspects under the Euramet framework.60, 61  Now that the ramp-up phase of the flagship project has been completed, the course for successful implementation needs to be set. To this end the Horizon Europe and Digital Europe programmes support research and development as well as the development of infrastructure. Networking between national and European funding measures takes place at different levels. For example, the QuantERA initiative supports transnational funding projects. There is also close coordination with the EU Commission, ESA and other EU member states, while the pooling of national and European funds for larger structural measures takes place, such as the pan-European procurement of quantum computers and their integration into an HPC environment in EuroHPC62 or the establishment of a European quantum communication network (EuroQCI)63 and its space component SAGA. Furthermore, the Framework Partnership Agreement for ‘open testing and experimentation’ was launched, which aims to bring together European testbeds on quantum technologies.64 In the field of standardisation, the publication of the roadmap on standardisation needs of the European CEN-CENELEC is expected.65, 66"
111,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Specifically in terms of technological sovereignty, it is important that close coordination with European partners continues. Especially in quantum computing and quantum communication, the aim is to achieve a leading position with European partners in terms of global competition and to position Europe as a technology provider. This should also prevent Europe from falling into critical dependencies.67 The German government is strengthening these European initiatives through targeted bilateral and multilateral activities with partners.

In addition to the targeted strengthening of collaborations, the danger of expertise exiting to non-European countries must also be taken seriously. Against this context the Federal Government is pursuing various approaches in its measures to prevent the loss of technological expertise in this technology of the future, for example, through the instrument of back-licensing for contractors within the framework of the DLR’s Quantum Computing Initiative, through corresponding project funding regulations and through measures within the framework of foreign trade law."

This is supported by research approaches to develop efficient and powerful hardware and software for future computer systems and applications. In order to bring new computing technologies such as quantum computing into use more quickly, they will be integrated into the existing ecosystem of high-performance computing. Furthermore, supercomputing centres, such as the sites of the Gauss Centre for Supercomputing, provide good conditions for integrating quantum computers. BMBF Research Programme on Microelectronics73 There is an important technological and structural interface that is particularly present in the field of microelectronics, the promotion of which is anchored in the framework programme. The traditional electronics addressed in this instance are important for enabling technologies, especially for the control of quantum computer chips. Process-wise there is also an overlap in the production of semiconductor-based quantum chips.  Cyber Security Strategy for Germany 202174  The Cyber Security Strategy published in 2021 forms the strategic framework for the Federal Government’s actions in the field of cybersecurity for the next five years. It describes the fundamental, long-term orientation of the Federal Government’s cybersecurity policy in the form of guidelines, areas of activity and strategic goals. It promotes action and is intended to shape future direction, enabling and promoting a targeted and coordinated interaction of all actors.  The Cyber Security Strategy for Germany and the cybersecurity strategies of the Federal States complement each other and thus intensify federal cooperation. Embedded in the European Cybersecurity Strategy, the Cybersecurity Strategy for Germany also contributes to shaping Europe’s digital future. The Federal Government’s Space Programme75 The BMWK supports German space research in research and development projects undertaken by German companies, research institutions and universities via the Space Agency in the DLR on the basis of the National Programme for Space and Innovation. Over the past two decades, a high level of technology development expertise for space quantum technology has been built up in basic research projects. The results and competencies are now being transferred into applications while expanding Germany’s leading role and tapping into the potential of quantum technology for satellite navigation (optical clocks and inertial navigation), satellite communication (quantum key distribution), earth observation (gravimetry/gradiometry) as well as automation technology and robotics (quantum computing to increase the autonomy of future space systems).  – Platform and Ecosystem for Quantum assisted Artificial Intelligence With this technology programme, the BMWK supports research, development and innovation projects that prove and demonstrate the technical feasibility and economic viability of quantum computing using the example of relevant, practical use cases, particularly in small and medium-sized enterprises. The quantum computing applications that are looked at include material simulation for hydrogen research, machine learning for the evaluation of used vehicles and the optimisation of processes in production and logistics. Furthermore, within the funding measures, foundations are also being developed for GDPR-compliant Cloud solutions for quantum computing carried out in Germany and Europe. In addition, the platform developed as part of the large-scale PlanQK – Platform and Ecosystem for Quantum assisted Artificial Intelligence project already offers public access to users and developers of software for quantum computing so that they can use and jointly implement quantum computing solutions.

Overview of activities of subordinate authorities, agencies and institutionally funded bodies Agentur für Innovation in der Cybersicherheit GmbH [cyber agency] The cyber agency finances and promotes medium to long-term research projects with high disruptive potential in the field of cyber security and related key emerging technologies. In this context the cyber agency should deliberately act in a risk-taking manner (open innovation and venture culture) and exhibit a high level of technological ambition. The cyber agency is not an institution undertaking university research and does not conduct independent research within the framework of programmes and projects. Within the framework of its entrepreneurial and scientific freedom, it aims to advance topics of cybersecurity and related key emerging technologies linked to internal and external security in a demand-oriented and application-oriented manner, thereby contributing to Germany’s technological sovereignty in cyberspace and the information realm.  Within the framework of the cyber agency’s current strategy (2022-2025), research projects to promote cyber security in the field of quantum technologies will also be tendered. A young man stands in a bluish-lit room and works on a laptop computer. Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik [Federal Office for Information  Security] (BSI) The BSI recommended initial quantum-safe procedures in March 2020 and issued more detailed assessments and recommendations for migrating to quantum computer-resistant procedures in its December 2021 guideline Making cryptography quantum-safe.76 In the high-security sector, approved products are already available that have implemented processes that are resistant to quantum computing. In addition, the BSI is conducting projects to investigate the security of quantum key distribution, which should contribute to the development of trustworthy and secure products. The BSI participates in the standardisation of the quantum-safe FrodoKEM and Classic McEliece procedures as recommended by it at ISO/IEC. In October 2022, a Preliminary Work Item for the Inclusion of key encapsulation mechanisms for PQC in ISO/IEC standards project was launched in ISO/IEC SC27 WG2 following a proposal from BSI. ISO standards for FrodoKEM and Classic McEliece should come out of this project. In order to continue to monitor the state of research on quantum computers, the project Laufende Aktualisierung der Studie Entwicklungsstand Quantencomputer [Ongoing update of the study on the state of development of quantum computers] will carry out annual revisions over the next three years of the study entitled Entwicklungsstand Quantencomputer [State of development of quantum computers], which was prepared in 2017 and has already been updated twice. In the first revision of the study, the NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) area in particular is dealt with more intensively and developments in error correction are discussed. In addition, an extended understanding of operational criteria is to be gained and the descriptions of algorithms, error correction and platforms are to be updated. Once the revision is complete, the new version will be available on the above website. As part of the BSI Sichere Implementierung einer allgemeinen Kryptobibliothek [Secure implementation of a general crypto library] project, which was completed in 2017, a BSI development branch including detailed crypto documentation was created for the Botan crypto library. In the current BSI Pflege und Weiterentwicklung der Kryptobibliothek Botan [Maintenance and further development of the Botan crypto library] project, a selection of procedures resistant to quantum computing is now being implemented in Botan, taking into account current developments in the NIST standardisation process and the BSI recommendations. This is intended to create a crypto library, tested in accordance with the current state of knowledge, for the deployment and use of post-quantum cryptography for the purposes of promoting the widespread use of quantum computer-resistant cryptography. In the current BSI Integration von Post-Quanten Kryptografie in den E-Mail-Client Thunderbird [Integration of post-quantum cryptography in the Thunderbird email client project], end-to-end encryption (E2EE) that is resistant to quantum computing is being implemented using encrypted and digitally signed emails. For this purpose, the OpenPGP-based public key cryptography of the popular email client Thunderbird is extended using encryption and signature methods from post-quantum cryptography. In addition to the implementation activities, a major part of the project is a corresponding draft on standardisation in the form of an RFC Internet Draft, which is intended for submission to the OpenPGP working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In the Quantencomputerresistente Authentisierung für VS-IT-Systeme [Quantum Computer Resistant Authentication for VS-IT Systems] feasability study, which will run until February 2023, the implications of authentication procedures that are resistant to quantum computing being placed in existing VS-IT systems and those that are under development, are all being investigated by an external contractor. The signature algorithms that currently form part of the NIST standardisation process and the products from manufacturers of VS IT recognised by BSI are all being taken into consideration. In particular, limitations such as the performance of the signature algorithms, crypto-agility as well as the migration capability of the VS-IT systems are taken into account in this feasibility study. In cooperation with the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), the BSI has pushed ahead with the creation of an initial protection profile for quantum key distribution (QKD) modules in accordance with Common Criteria. The Protection Profile, which is limited to taking into account prepare-and-measure protocols and point-to-point connections, is now available in a first version and is to be certified soon. It represents the first stage in achieving an evaluation methodology, but requires the development of further standards and background documentation until actual certification of specific products is possible. Achieving a secure implementation of QKD protocols requires a solid understanding of the possible side-channel attacks on QKD modules, something that has already been demonstrated for many specific implementations. To this end the BSI has commissioned the preparation of a study that will present the scientific state of research on side-channel attacks on QKD systems in a standard and complete manner. This is a first necessary step towards the creation of an evaluation methodology for QKD side-channel attacks. In close cooperation with the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt [National Metrology Institute of Germany] (PTB), the BSI is involved in the coordination of the BMBF-funded Schirmprojekt Quantenkommunikation Deutschland [Quantum Communication Germany] umbrella project. The key goal of the Quantum Communication Germany umbrella project is to establish quantum communication as a technology that can be used in practice, is secure and commercially available in Germany and Europe. The BSI therefore focuses on taking aspects of information security (for example, the security of QKD protocols) into account at an early stage. Bundesdruckerei GmbH Bundesdruckerei GmbH, including its subsidiary Maurer Electronics GmbH, is a leading German high-tech security company headquartered in Berlin. Providing innovative solutions, products and technologies ‘Made in Germany’, it protects identities and data. In this way it creates trust and legal certainty within digital society, enabling sovereign action to be taken by countries, companies and citizens in the analogue and digital world. As a company that is part of the Bundesdruckerei Group, it is able to draw on more than 250 years of experience, paving the way to a secure digital future. Bundesdruckerei GmbH currently holds more than 4,100 national and international patents, employs around 2,600 people and in 2021 generated sales of EUR 642 million.  Bundesdruckerei has been working on quantum technologies since the PlanQK and PoQuiID projects. Their interest in both projects was a proof-of-concept pertaining to application scenarios using the quantum computing capacities of project partners, which are currently being developed. In 2021, the Qu-Gov –  Quantum Technologies for the Federal Administration project was also added as a result of a direct commission from the Federal Ministry of Finance. With this, a top-down approach was followed, in which proof-of-concepts or proof-of-values are developed for use cases taken from the sovereign-administrative environment and then evaluated in a platform-open manner. By the end of 2024, quantum technologies for the federal (financial) administration will therefore be evaluated and researched, and initial use cases will be tested.

The first partners have already been found or are within the selection process. This project represents an interface between science, industry and administration and, therefore, regards itself as an enabler for a modern, future-oriented administrative structure, which ties in seamlessly with digital topics such as the Federal Data Atlas and the Federal AI Competence Centre.  At that time, Bundesdruckerei, together with DB Systel, founded the Bundesquantenallianz (BQA) in order to research quantum technologies that went beyond the scope of the project on behalf of the federal administration, together with federal or federal-linked companies. Currently, the BQA is in discussion with other federal institutions such as PTB or BAM. This federal quantum alliance is thus a useful addition to the various ‘quantum alliances’ in Germany that have been shown to date, since it explicitly addresses companies and authorities owned by the Federal Government and can multiply the insights gained in the Qu-Gov project.

To this end the ‘Competence Centre Quantum Enabled Technologies’ was founded within the Innovation & Technology division of BWI. Their stated aim is to raise awareness of quantum technologies in the BWI and Bundeswehr environment. Market and technology screenings, knowledge transfer from consulting projects and individual trials are all used to draw up specific recommendations for action for BWI’s service portfolio. Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft e. V.  [German Research Foundation] (DFG) The DFG’s primary task is to promote cutting-edge, knowledge-driven research. The DFG is particularly active in those areas where research itself determines the topics, following the dynamics of scientific knowledge processes. Eligible individuals, groups or institutions can therefore submit funding proposals to the DFG at any time and on any topic. The increasing demand for both individual funding and coordinated programmes, and the associated increase in the volume of awards in the field of quantum technology, show that the DFG’s instruments are addressing needs across the entire spectrum of funding.  In 2021 a total of 149 projects carrying an annual funding amount of EUR 58.6 million directly related to the research field of ‘quantum technology’ were being funded at the time. Of this, EUR 40.4 million was awarded to Clusters of Excellence.77 This corresponds to an increase of about 11% within three years. Through coordinated programmes (Collaborative Research Centres, Research Training Groups, Clusters of Excellence), individual research areas are often strongly influenced by quantum technology, while the entire consortium tends to pursue fundamental research in natural sciences and engineering.  Over the course of its formative and strategic trading in the European Research Area, the DFG participates in the ERA-Net . The EU-funded association of 39 research funding organisations drawn from 31 countries supports research on quantum technologies, specifically through calls for transnational projects. In the last call for proposals, the DFG was responsible for funding participation from Germany in fundamental science-oriented projects. The 19 projects partly funded by the DFG will start in 2022. The next call for proposals, in which the DFG plans to participate, will take place in 2023.  Within the framework of two major research instrumentation initiatives for research into quantum technology, which were launched in 2021, the DFG is providing support to eight universities through a total of approximately EUR 17.7 million. The aim of large-scale equipment initiatives is to make the latest technology available for research. Two tenders were issued: Spin-based quantum light microscopes and Quantum communication test environments (QCDE).  In addition, the DFG has also been funding the Research Training Group  since 2021, the aim of which is to establish a new professional group of ‘photonic quantum engineers’.

140,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"Weather and climate simulations represent a primary use case for utilising high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures due to their computing power and storage capacity demands. With the ICON-Consolidated development line, the DWD and its partners from the ICON consortium (Max Planck Institut für Meteorology [MPI-M], German Climate Computing Center [DKRZ], Karlsruhe Institute of Technologe [KIT)] are also preparing the ICON weather and climate model for future HPC architectures. When the technology is sufficiently mature, this will also be completed for those architectures based on quantum computing. The expected extreme increase in computing power will allow even more accurate simulations of atmospheric processes to take place at a hitherto unprecedented resolution, while at the same time any uncertainties will be better qualified. Developments in quantum computing for the application of solutions derived from mathematical equations, used to describe processes in the atmosphere, is therefore both very sensible and imperative. Cyber Defence and Smart Data Research Institute (FI CODE) at the University of the Bundeswehr Munich The FI CODE has been an IBM Quantum Hub between 2018 and 2023 and is therefore one of very few to gain exclusive access to the IBM quantum computer infrastructure worldwide.

[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres] (HGF) The Helmholtz Centres that contribute to research in quantum technology78 are organised in the Helmholtz Quantum platform, which has published an overarching strategy for the Helmholtz Association.79 This identifies five quantum technology fields in which the centres, along with their research, contribute to different focal points: 1. Quantum computing, 2. Quantum communication, 3. Quantum sensor technology, 4.Quantum materials and fundamental research, and5.Quantum simulations and numerical methods. Current research ranges from an understanding of fundamental quantum phenomena to the design of quantum states and the development of components for the realisation and deployment of fully functional devices as well as prototypes. The plan is to develop and provide infrastructures together with the user communities, including exchange platforms and qualification programmes, in order to increase potential for the implementation of applications, co-design and future personnel. These include material characterisation platforms, quantum computers in high-performance computing centres, and the development of a widely usable software package for quantum computing. Strong expertise in materials is necessary for excellent, disruptive technologies in the long term, while the integration of quantum computing into supercomputing centres ensures the full potential of quantum computing is made accessible, connecting to the user community at an early stage. Large software packages are now reaching the complexity of infrastructures and are a prerequisite for users. In the field of sensor technology, the stated goal is, among other things, the lab-on-chip integration of quantum sensors for application areas such as biology or medicine. Together with partners from universities, research organisations and industry, the Helmholtz Association aims to define far-reaching technological goals for the next 10 years and beyond, and to pursue them jointly at all levels, from fundamental science to systems engineering as well as applications.  Over recent years, further outstanding international scientists have been recruited for the community. Many centres are establishing new institutes for research into quantum technologies and the commu nity is investing in central infrastructures that will enable major advances as a technological hub. In the Helmholtz Association (as of 2021), there are already around 500 people working directly on research into quantum technologies. The researchers lead and par-ticipate in small and large projects that are funded, for example, by the BMBF, the EU or Helmholtz itself, and they are therefore closely involved in the national and European strategy.Examples of specific goals for the next five years as formulated in the strategy paper: ∙ Systematic further development of promisingscalable platforms for the realisation of multiplequbits in order to realise small-scale demonstratorsbeyond the state-of-the-art, with up to 100 qubitsand low error rates for quantum computers andsimulations."

157,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"An additional contribution by DLR outside the programme-oriented research funding of the HGF is the DLR Quantum Computing Initiative, which has been funded with around EUR 740 million from the fiscal stimulus package for the construction of quantum computer systems, the development of software and initial applications. The initiative’s approach is to implement the systems by commissioning companies, especially start-ups. For this purpose, 80% of the funds flow into those companies that cover their full costs and can even achieve a profit margin. This is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises or start-ups who have less financial power. The development of quantum computers for DLR’s research fields is therefore building up a parallel industrial ecosystem. At the same time the results (intellectual property) and co-determination rights in this potentially sensitive area of technology are to be secured for DLR, although the companies executing the work are to be given the freedom to act through a grant-back. In addition, co-location at the DLR institutes in Hamburg and Ulm, among others, provides incentives for relevant, innovative companies from the European economic area to settle in Germany. A measuring device in a laboratory environment. Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften e. V. [Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science] (MPG) The Max Planck Society (MPG) began funding basic research on quantum science and technology (QST) at an early stage in the spirit of the second quantum revolution. In 1981, the Max Planck Institute (MPI) for Quantum Optics was founded in Garching, in 1993 the experimental branch of the MPI for Gravitational Physics was set up in Hanover, in 1994 it was the turn of the MPI for the Physics of Complex Systems in Dresden, and in 2009 the MPI for the Physics of Light in Erlangen. In addition, the Max Planck Institutes for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, for Computer Science in Saarbrücken, for Nuclear Physics in Heidelberg, for Multidisciplinary Natural Sciences in Göttingen, for Chemical Solid-state Physics in Dresden, for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter in Hamburg, for Microstructure Physics in Halle, for Mathematics in Science in Leipzig, for Intelligent Systems in Tübingen, for Security and Privacy in Bochum as well as the Fritz Haber Institute in Berlin also work in part on aspects of this topic. With the fundamental research carried out on QST at all these institutes, the MPG sees itself as a pioneer and supporter of the current specialist programmes for quantum technologies.  The MPG regards QST as a strategically important topic, not only in terms of fundamental research, but also in terms of the potential economic benefits. Germany is excellently positioned when it comes to fundamentals and it can take up a leading role in the global competition for QST.  The MPG contributes central expertise in the area of QST, including in the following fields:  ∙ Quantum computing (Garching, Erlangen, Bochum,Tübingen)"

164,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"The MPG sees its contribution to the national strategy primarily within the context of the continuation and expansion of excellent fundamental research. This also includes opening up new subject areas, paying attention to the patenting of new ideas, promoting spin-off companies and start-ups, and participating in national and international research networks. The MPG makes essential contributions to the transfer of fundamental phenomena of the second quantum revolution into application-relevant technologies.  For example, the MPG played a key role in the expert council that identified the central challenges in the field of quantum computing and issued recommendations for future action in the form of a national roadmap at the beginning of 2021.  The MPG has tightened up its strategy with regard to QST; extensive activities have been launched, both internally and externally, two of which are briefly explained below:  Max Planck Quantum Alliance (MPQA)  An important component of a sustainable long-term strategy for the MPG in the area of QST is the establishment of an internationally visible umbrella organisation that unites the various activities (new and existing) within the MPG and provides a platform for the implementation of further measures. This MPQA initiative aims to increase the global visibility of the MPG in QST, to strengthen the collaboration within the MPG between the participating departments in the field of QST, and to increase competitiveness in attracting top talent who are very much in demand internationally. As some of the QST research topics are located between the core areas of different institutes (especially with regard to scientific concepts and/or the required technological infrastructures), the interdisciplinarity of QST remains an ongoing challenge.  Munich Quantum Valley (MQV)  The MPG is a driving force behind the Munich Quantum Valley initiative, which aims to establish   quantum computing and quantum technologies in Bavaria as a unique network of its kind in Europe. The members of the initiative (the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BAdW), the Ludwig- Maximilians-Universität München (LMU), the Tech-nische Universität München (TUM), the Friedrich- Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU), the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft (FhG), the German Aerospace Center (DLR) and the MPG) signed the founding char-ter of the MQV Association on 27 January 2022. The Free State of Bavaria is supporting the initiative with EUR 300 million in funding from the High-Tech Agen-da Bavaria until 2025. In addition, there is more than EUR 80 million from funding programmes run by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (from the Quantum Technologies Stimulus Package) and the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action, which was obtained through the submission of joint applications from members of the initiative. More than 40 scientific institutions, research insti-tutes and companies have thus far joined forces under the umbrella of the MQV. The main goal of the initiative is to establish a Centre for Quantum Computing and Quantum Technol-ogies (ZQQ) over the next five years. This centre will provide access to computers based on the three technologies in quantum computing that seem to be most promising at the moment: superconducting, ionic and atomic qubits. Research and industry are thereby closely interlinked to ensure efficient tech-nology transfer and to promote the establishment of start-up companies. The initiative also envisages the establishment of a quantum technology park that can be used by the research institutions together with the more than 20 German and European high-tech com-panies in the Greater Munich area that have shown a great interest, or are already active, in the field of QST. Among them are companies such as Airbus, attocube, BMW, Fujitsu, Google, Huawei, Infineon, Menlo Systems, Microsoft, OHB, Rohde&Schwarz, Siemens, Toptica Photonics and Volkswagen. Research capacities are thereby bundled together and scientific findings are translated into marketable products at an accelerated pace. In addition, these activities are supported through qualification and training offers as well as funding programmes for quantum technology start-ups.  Inner workings of the apparatus in which ions are trapped. Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt  [National Metrology Institute of Germany] (PTB) Within the scope of its statutory mandate, the Federal Institute of Metrology (PTB) is responsible for traceability in the field of metrology and the provision of services, as well as in the field of quantum technologies. Examples of PTB-relevant quantum technologies are high-precision quantum standards for electrical quantities (resistance, voltage), high-precision sensors for magnetic fields, for pressure or for temperature, single-electron pumps with high-grade non-traditional properties as well as single-photon sources and detectors for quantum radiometry and quantum cryptography. Furthermore, ultra-stable and accurate optical clocks with far-reaching fields of application in communication, navigation and geodesy all feature among PTB’s significant research results. In the past PTB has consistently expanded the further development of quantum metrology and quantum sensor technology as part of its regular strategic planning as a result of the enormous economic potential and expected demand from research and industry. Within the framework of the representation of SI units, which have been significantly based on quantum physics since 2019, PTB combines the most important fields of quantum technology (QT) in a technologically leading position under one roof and is characterised by a long-standing, close cooperation with industry. This puts PTB in a position to support the German economy in a unique way. New economic fields unique in the world can be opened up in Germany in this way and a clear locational advantage can therefore be developed in Germany.  To this end the Quantum Technology Competence Centre (QTZ), named in the Quantentechnologien –  von den Grundlagen zum Markt [Quantum Technologies – from Fundamentals to Market] framework programme, has been established since 2019 as PTB’s reference point for access to QT expertise and infrastructure for partners from industry and science. The central goal is to support the development of QT with economic potential. This enables PTB’s expert knowledge and its role as a national metrology institute to be effectively used to exploit the potential of quantum technologies so that optimum added value for society and the economy can be generated.  The QTZ focuses on the fields of action that are briefly set out below. 1.	 Robust components and technologies. The application of QT in the market requires robust anduser-friendly QT components and devices that canalso be used by non-experts in the tough environment of industrial operations. PTB enables QTcomponents already established at PTB (and otherresearch institutions) to be developed further tomeet the requirements of this practical application."

The user platforms provide robust and user-friendly measuring stationsin key areas of QT and are to be used by externalpartners, supported by the staff and infrastructureat PTB. The aim here is to enable partners to gaintheir own experience in QT without having to buildthe infrastructure themselves, something that typically requires very high levels of investment andlead times, especially in QT. A lack of contact andexperience in relation to the techniques used andtheir time-consuming set-up represent a furtherchallenge, especially for small and medium-sizedenterprises (SMEs). Particularly in a potentially verydynamic and disruptive field such as QT, this can bea major disadvantage that is difficult to remedy interms of competitiveness, and is therefore an issuethat QTZ is intended to help resolve."
167,2,GER,2023,Quantum Technologies Conceptual Framework Programme,"4.	 Hands-on training, quantum education and support for start-ups. The implementation of QT in themarket requires well-trained staff, for which thereare currently not enough training opportunities.Already existing connections at PTB with importantplayers from industry provide an excellent startingpoint for training a ‘quantum work force’ of thiskind promptly and as required, making use of userplatforms that are particularly suited to this purpose. Another option for knowledge transfer is theencouragement and promotion of business start-ups."

Wissenschaftsgemeinschaft Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz e. V. [Leibniz Association] In the value chain, Leibniz Association institutions cover the gamut from fundamental research on quantum phenomena and materials to material and device development, as well as systemic heterointegration and prototype solutions. They research a wide variety of material systems and technology approaches to develop innovative solutions. Completely new possibilities can arise, for example, from the lived merging of research in microelectronics and materials sciences. With this, research into new oxide, metallic, organic and hybrid functional and nanomaterials and structures is undertaken, which could have great potential for future micro- and nanotechnologies, thereby addressing aspects of integrated smart systems, nanoelectronics and quantum computing.  Within the Leibniz Association the following institutes conduct research in the field of quantum technologies: the Ferdinand Braun Institute – the Leibniz Institute for Highest Frequency Technology (FBH), the Leibniz Institute for Solid State and Materials Research (IFW), the Leibniz Institute for Innovative Microelectronics (IHP), the Leibniz Institute for Crystal Growth (IKZ), the Leibniz Institute for Surface Modification (IOM), the Leibniz Institute for Photonic Technologies (IPHT), the Paul Drude Institute for Solid State Electronics (PDI) and the Weierstrass Institute for Applied Analysis and Stochastics (WIAS). In addition, the disciplinary breadth of the Leibniz Association also covers economic and social science aspects of the new technologies and opens up new areas of application in the natural, environmental and life sciences. The interdisciplinary Leibniz Institutes conduct research in the three main areas of quantum communication, quantum metrology and sensor technology, and quantum computing, as well as on ‘enabling’ technologies, in particular photonics, laser, microwave, signal and cryogenics, control electronics, integrated systems and new software algorithms. They develop materials for quantum technologies and characterise the corresponding optical, electrical and structural properties, conduct research on the effects of light-matter interaction and the phenomena of quantum and nanophotonics, and therefore make a fundamental contribution to knowledge-oriented research questions in quantum physics. The Leibniz Institutes also supply European research institutes with critical material systems such as isotopically pure semiconductors, therefore making an important contribution to increasing the resilience of the European Research Area. With the help of innovative processes and process technologies, as well as through modelling and simulation, it is possible to design and develop new components: electronic or opto-electronic semiconductor components, multi-qubit circuits, quantum sensors and detectors, qubit control, drive and readout circuits. Individual Leibniz institutes master the systemic and hybrid integration of these components and enable proof-of-concept demonstrators, complex systems and industrial-grade prototypes up to small-scale production. With regard to the tap-proof transmission of encrypted information, the institutes are researching photonic modules and their microintegration in the field of quantum communication. In respect of quantum metrology and sensor technology for navigation, the synchronisation of networks, medical diagnostics and highly sensitive imaging techniques, research is undertaken to develop atomic quantum sensors, quantum sensors based on optically pumped magnetometers and defect centres, as well as sensory surfaces."

This forms an excited spectrum that can be used, even at room temperature, as a single photon source, as the computing unit of a quantum computer or, due to its sensitivity to magnetic fields, as a highly sensitive sensor.  R&D: Research and development Refers primarily to pre-competitive work in a company or research institution that carries a significant technical risk. This is in contrast to competitive or experimental development, as well as product development. Full stack Refers to the sum of all components of a platform or an overall technical system that build on each other. The origins of the term lie in software development. In terms of quantum computing, however, the hardware components are also included. Galileo A system of navigation satellites operated by the European Union, which are comparable to the American GPS (Global Positioning System). SMEs: Small and medium-sized enterprises According to the definition by the EU, these are companies with fewer than 250 employees and an annual turnover of no more than EUR 50 million or a balance sheet total of no more than EUR 43 million. NISQ: Noisy intermediate scale quantum computer Interim objective of achieving ‘medium-sized’ quantum computers with 50 to a couple of 100 qubits. These are intended to demonstrate the potential of quantum computers beyond simulations, but will still be severely limited in terms of their computing power due to a lack of control over all qubits. Optical clock Also known as an atomic clock. The frequencies of atomic transitions, usually caesium or rubidium, can be used to calculate a highly accurate time signal. The method has been used for decades to measure world time. However, further technological advances with regard to methodology may also mean it is suitable for future use in telecommunications or for measuring the absolute elevation in terrain (relativistic geodesy). PQC: Post-quantum cryptography Describes the need to further develop or replace current encryption methods if they can no longer be deemed secure given the new computing possibilities of quantum computers. Quantum gyroscope Refers to a measuring device that uses quantum effects to measure rotational movements and their rates of rotation. (Quantum) gyroscopes are used in particular for navigation applications. QKD: Quantum key distribution Encryption technology for data communication. In contrast to methods that are currently used, QKD uses the quantum mechanical property of entanglement of states during data transmission and is therefore intrinsically interception-proof, meaning that any eavesdropping or tapping could always be detected, resulting in a breakdown of communications. Qubits: Quantum bits Smallest logical computing unit of a quantum computer in analogy to the bits of traditional computers. In contrast to these, qubits can also assume arbitrary states between ‘0’ and ‘1’, which is one of the key features and potential advantages of a quantum computer. TRL: Technology readiness level Describes the stage of maturity of technologies.

These inventions will improve the lives of everyone in the UK, from improving healthcare and speeding up drug discovery, to boosting economic growth and security and providing jobs. They will also help us tackle climate change, build a sustainable future for our children, and help the UK to respond to growing global volatility, as set out in the government’s Integrated Review Refresh.  Quantum rewrites the rules of classical physics, and in doing so allows us to do things previously thought impossible. Take, for example, exquisitely sensitive brain scanners that will reveal new insights into epilepsy or dementia, or sensors that let us see what lies beneath the ground from the surface. These are already being used in real-world settings today.  In 2023, the government created the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) to deliver our mission to be the most innovative economy in the world and a science and technology superpower. Quantum technologies are at the core of this mission, not only as one of our five priority technologies of tomorrow – quantum, AI, engineering biology, semiconductors, future telecoms – but also as a technology that could release the full potential of every other on that list.   The UK is already a global leader in quantum technologies. In 2014 we set up the National Quantum Technologies Programme, the first of its kind in the world, to support excellent research and begin to take technologies out of the research environment.  The UK’s highly collaborative quantum community reflects that foresight from nearly ten years ago. The UK has world-leading strengths in quantum, including our deep research talent, the knowledge built up across the different quantum technologies, our rapidly growing quantum sector, and our strengths throughout quantum and related supply chains.   We are determined to build on these strengths with vision and long-term funding certainty. This national strategy sets out our new ten-year ambitious commitment to quantum technologies in the UK. We firmly believe that Britain should lead the world in this physical science and deliver opportunities and jobs in hardware, engineering and advanced manufacturing as well as in software and applications across the economy. As part of our new department’s ethos of taking immediate action backed up by strong long-term planning we are more than doubling our investment into quantum by investing £2.5 billion in quantum over the next ten years, with the aim of attracting significant additional private investment on top of that.   This ten-year plan will fund new frontiers of quantum research, support and develop our growing quantum sector, prepare our wider economy for the quantum revolution and ensure that the UK leads internationally in the regulation and ethical use of quantum technologies. We will make the UK the home for cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, the best place in the world to start and grow a quantum business, a leading voice in the international quantum and tech community, and a magnet for international quantum talent.  We have worked hand in hand with the UK quantum community to bring this national strategy to fruition; I would like to thank everyone who has contributed to this process. The hard work starts now to deliver on its goals together."
2,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"The Rt Hon Michelle Donelan MP  Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology  Executive Summary  Over the next ten years, quantum technologies will revolutionise many aspects of life in the UK and bring enormous benefits to the UK economy, society and the way we can protect our planet. The UK has a world-leading position and quantum is one of the top priorities for the government, as set out in the Integrated Review Refresh. This strategy sets out our plan for the next ten years, building on the successes to date, to realise the incredible potential of these technologies for the UK.  Quantum technologies take advantage of phenomena at the atomic scale to find new ways to manipulate information. These technologies will one day make it possible to solve complex problems that are currently impossible to solve with even the most powerful high-performance classical computer and will allow us to reach entirely new frontiers in sensing, timing, imaging and communications.  Quantum technologies already offer possible solutions to some of our greatest societal challenges and, perhaps most excitingly, offer future capabilities that are yet to be explored. They will improve lives, drive economic growth and create jobs, and make us more secure.  •The exponential increase in computing power from quantum computers couldrevolutionise our healthcare system - from dramatically improved drugdiscovery techniques to providing personalised treatment to an individualbased on genetic and environmental factors -, help to manage and make bestuse of our national energy infrastructure, and even accelerate the path toautonomy and entirely new AI applications. It could deliver on oursustainability goals by improving solar panels and batteries as well as cuttingthe energy demands of data centres. Over the next three to five years,quantum computing could deliver $5-10 billion of benefits across the world;and this rises to $450-$850 billion in the next fifteen to thirty years.1"

5,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"greater resilience for railways, telecommunications and emergency services - as well as helping to secure the global communications network against cybercrime. Quantum communications could account for an estimated $8 billion in revenue by 2030.3"
6,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Those countries that are amongst the first to develop quantum technologies, and use them widely across the economy, will have vast advantages in terms of productivity, economic growth, health, sustainability, and national security and resilience, not least because of the anticipated ability of quantum computers to undermine cryptography used to secure the internet. This means that quantum is a priority technology for the government, and one that will remain critically important for our economic growth, economic security, national security and defence. We are in a global race to develop and commercialise these capabilities. The UK was an early mover, but other countries are accelerating their own efforts. Investing in quantum now, building on the strengths that we have already established, will ensure that we deliver on quantum technologies for the UK.  Building on strong foundations  We have already made great progress in the UK, with a £1 billion investment in research and development from 2014.4 Over its ten-year lifetime, this programme has built leading capabilities in quantum computing, sensors and timing, imaging and communications, and helped to build their path to market. As a result, the UK has considerable strengths and opportunities in quantum:  •We have invested in quantum skills, funding postgraduate research andfellowships, and have some of the world’s leading quantum experts. Our talentis a key draw to locate a quantum business in the UK."
7,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•We have a rapidly growing quantum sector - we rank second in the world tothe US for the number of quantum companies and second in attracting privateinvestment, leading the competition in Europe.5"
8,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•The UK’s developing quantum sector has a broad range of capabilities, withcompanies across the range of quantum technologies – computing,communications, sensing, imaging, and timing. We are also acknowledged asworld-leading in developing quantum computing software for error correctionand applications."
9,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•We have industrial strengths in the supply chain, in areas such as photonics,electronics and cryogenics, which are essential to quantum technologies. Wehave world leading clusters, such as the compound semiconductor cluster in South Wales, and a long-established photonics cluster in Scotland."
10,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•The extent of collaboration within the quantum community in the UK is aparticular and rare strength. The government has funded 139 projectsinvolving 141 quantum organisations through the Innovate UKCommercialising Quantum Challenge alone.6 The interplay between thedifferent elements of the community in the UK – from hardware, to software, tocomponents and enablers – is particularly strong."
11,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•Our testing and assurance capabilities, through the National PhysicalLaboratory, are amongst the best in the world and a key enabler for thesector."
12,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•We also have key user sector strengths, for example, in space, finance,aerospace, defence and life sciences, which provide a strong domestic marketfor quantum technologies."
13,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•We are also strong in other technologies, such as artificial intelligence, highperformance computing, space, telecoms, and engineering biology, whichwhen integrated with quantum technologies could boost capabilities andimpact."
14,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Government investments to date through the National Quantum Technologies Programme have created a unique and diverse pool of talent, capabilities and know-how within our quantum sector. However, given the pace of change globally and the challenge of bringing quantum into widespread use, it is the right time to set out a clear ambition and funding certainty for the next ten years to capitalise on this leading position and to accelerate the path to commercialisation.  This strategy sets out a bold and ambitious approach to supporting quantum technologies in the UK across the broad spectrum of quantum computing, sensing, timing, imaging and communications. We will develop UK strengths across different hardware platforms, software and components, and reinforce our capabilities throughout the supply chains. Although international collaboration is an essential part of our approach, it is not in the UK’s interests to rely purely on others for access to these critical technologies. We will also invest in and strengthen the key ecosystem enablers, such as skills, infrastructure, regulation and standards. We will monitor the development of these technologies, both in the UK and in other countries, and the development of the market, to ensure we can flex our approach to deliver the best possible outcome for the UK.  A new ten-year vision, plan and commitment  Our vision is for the UK to be a leading quantum-enabled economy by 2033, with a world leading sector, and where quantum technologies are an integral part of the UK’s future digital infrastructure and advanced manufacturing base, driving growth and helping to build a thriving and resilient economy and society.  To achieve this, we will commit £2.5 billion to developing quantum technologies in the UK over the ten years from 2024 – more than doubling current public investment -which will aim to generate an additional £1 billion of private investment into theprogramme. This programme will: •Ensure the UK is home to world-leading quantum science and engineering,growing UK knowledge and skills"

18,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"This strategy sets out a ten-year vision, plan and priority actions. As quantum technologies develop, the UK will need to make some key strategic decisions about where to focus efforts to realise the benefits from these technologies. At this early stage it is important to continue to build the science, grow the vibrant ecosystem, explore a range of technology platforms and parts of the supply chain where the UK has world leading strengths, in addition to focussing on software and use case exploration. But it’s also important to be more targeted where and when we can, working with industry to accelerate development within high value applications as they emerge to grow a world class quantum sector and deliver benefits for the economy and society.   We will therefore develop our priority actions over time within the wider programme based on progress and wider trends, in full consultation with the UK quantum community. We will report regularly to the National Science and Technology Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, and publish an annual report on progress.

49,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Introduction: Quantum Technologies in the UK  What are quantum technologies?  Many technologies that are part of our everyday life are based on our knowledge of quantum mechanics, from the lasers that are used in smartphones or for modern telecommunications, to superconducting devices which have revolutionised medical imaging.   Today, second-generation quantum technologies make the realisation of entirely new advances possible, based on the ability to generate, detect and control quantum states. We are on the cusp of a new wave of innovation that will offer a step change in performance from an unprecedented increase in compute power, to exquisitely precise sensors, and enhanced communications.  The advantages that these enabling quantum technologies will offer, alongside AI, high performance computing (HPC), and a broader suite of technologies, will transform how we interact with the world. Such technologies hold the potential to increase resilience, national security, productivity and competitiveness across many critical sectors including health, cyber security and defence and help tackle some of the biggest challenges that we face. Quantum technologies also pose potential national security challenges, not least the expectation that quantum computers will be capable of undermining the cryptography used to secure internet data.  The physical properties of nature at the atomic or subatomic level, and quantum systems, are both incredibly susceptible to outside interference (which creates exquisitely sensitive sensors or precise clocks) and exhibit novel properties (like the ability to link particles (entanglement), or for them to exist in multiple states (superposition)) which means they offer novel ways of storing, processing and sending information. Quantum technologies use these quantum effects to, for example, perform computation, create images of objects, sense the size, shape or movement of an object, or provide a timing signal.  The UK has an exceptional history in modern quantum physics, from the seminal theoretical work of Artur Ekert in the early 1990s that showed that encrypted keys can be secured by quantum systems, to the cutting-edge technologies now being developed in our research organisations and businesses.  The National Quantum Technologies Programme  The UK’s visionary National Quantum Technologies Programme (NQTP), first formed in 2014, has brought together government, academia and industry to bring the promising science of quantum into wider society. It has invested:  •£214 million in research through the Quantum Research Hubs, a nationalnetwork of four university-led Quantum Technology Hubs, funded by theEngineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), to accelerateprogress towards the development and commercialisation of quantumtechnologies across communications, sensors and timing, enhanced imagingand computing.7 These Hubs involve over 30 research organisations spreadacross the UK,8 bringing critical mass in an engaged ecosystem."

56,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"The National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC)  The National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) is a new research institution funded through UKRI, which is dedicated to accelerating the development of quantum computing by addressing the challenges of scalability and readiness. Working with partners across industry, government and the research community, the NQCC will create the necessary R&D capabilities through coordination and delivery of a technical programme, alongside the commissioning and operation of new facilities.  The programme will deliver assured quantum computing capability, enabling the UK to remain internationally competitive. The centre will be headquartered in a purpose-built facility at the STFC’s Rutherford Appleton Laboratory campus in Oxfordshire, which is due for completion in 2023. UK Strengths  Today, the UK has a thriving academic and industrial quantum community.  Regional centres of excellence exist up and down the country, from the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC) in Harwell, to the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Teddington, the Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics in Glasgow, to our four research hubs led by the Universities of York, Birmingham, Glasgow, and Oxford. These centres and their communities have built wide-ranging networks, bringing together experts from universities, national laboratories, and industry partners to collaborate on quantum science and technologies. This ecosystem is widely admired and emulated by other countries as it has built a vibrant collaborative enterprise, connecting great research to translation and commercialisation.   The National Hubs in quantum science and technologies have claimed many world firsts since the programme began, such as the first industrial demonstrations of a quantum gravimeter (capable of sensing underground objects), the first chip-to-chip Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) encrypted transmission, and achieving world record performance in ion trap quantum computing.  The UK is in the top five in a range of metrics for global academic excellence.11"
57,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Quantum Sensors and Timing  Despite our increasing ability to detect and monitor things that exist on land, sea or in space, we still often resort to digging or drilling holes to find objects such as forgotten pipes and cabling or to locate and measure sinkholes and mine workings. Researchers from the EPSRC-supported UK National Quantum Hub in Sensors and Timing and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) have teamed up with specialist environmental engineering company, RSK and Teledyne e2V to develop a new ground mapping technology, a ‘quantum gravity gradiometer’.  The device works by detecting variations in microgravity using the principles of quantum physics. This was tested outside the lab for the first time in 2022, successfully detecting a hidden underground object. The technology offers potentially faster, cheaper, and more reliable capabilities than current systems, with the opportunity to reduce the time needed for surveys, for example, from a month to a few days.  The programme has led to the successful transfer of knowledge and technology into many UK companies; generating and supporting around 50 quantum technology start-ups; nurturing a highly skilled quantum workforce, including over 470 PhD candidates and many fellowships; attracting more venture capital investment per capita into quantum technology than any other country.12  New quantum devices that have been developed in the UK across computing, communications, sensing and timing are now being trialled globally, from wearable brain scanners that will improve our understanding of neurological disorders, to miniaturised atomic clocks that will end dependence on satellites for timing which is critical for everything from healthcare to navigation and financial services.   Recent developments in the sector show that the UK is an innovative centre for the commercialisation and deployment of quantum technologies. These include the launch of the first commercial trial of a quantum secured communication service in London, the integration of quantum gas cameras into monitoring systems in the oil and gas industry, and the release of a platform agnostic quantum computing operating system.  The UK is now home to the largest number of quantum start-ups in Europe.13 It attracts more capital investment than any other country in Europe.14 Businesses supported by the UK Commercialising Quantum Challenge have raised over £425m in private sector financing since the programme began.15"
58,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Over 120 UK businesses partner with the UK national research hubs in quantum technologies16 and, in recognition of this connected community, a number of international quantum companies have chosen to locate operations in the UK. We also have leading businesses across the supply chain (including lasers, cryogenic systems, high vacuum equipment, electronic control systems and photon detectors) who are winning contracts in the UK and exporting to the quantum community in global markets.  More broadly, the UK is a major pull for global talent, investment and collaboration due to our global reputation for R&D excellence, an innovative and transparent regulatory environment, world-class intellectual property and competitive tax regimes, as well as dedicated visa schemes for innovative companies. The UK is also home to high R&D investment sectors that are essential in the development of emerging technologies, such as advanced manufacturing, automotive, aerospace and finance.   Challenges  As demonstrated above, the potential applications of quantum technologies are vast. This is both an opportunity and a challenge, with the sheer range of possible uses meaning it often takes time and considerable expertise for prospective users to understand the potential of the technology and focus on the most impactful application.   Other challenges specific to quantum technologies include:  •The technology is still emerging. For quantum computing, which is further from themarket than other applications, there is still uncertainty around which technical approachwill prove to be the most effective to solving the scientific and engineering challenge. It is also important to understand the interplay between quantum hardware and software, as well as supply chains specific to each technical approach, in order to build a strong UK capability. In other areas, such as sensing and timing, although a step change in performance can be demonstrated in a lab, it is not always clear when quantum will be the preferred solution in real-world settings. •We are still in the early days of commercialising quantum, with most quantumtechnologies in the research, development or early demonstration phase. Developingquantum products and services can be a long and challenging process, with the needfor sustained investment and support before profits can be made."
59,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•The quantum sector must compete with more established sectors to access packagingand fabrication capabilities, challenging when companies are having to undertakeexploratory design cycles in small batches. As with other deep tech sectors, the capitalrequirement for research, development and deployment of products is considerable.This challenge is likely to increase in the coming years as products get closer to marketand companies require more access to expensive infrastructure and commercial scalepackaging and fabrication facilities."
60,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•Demand for quantum skills outstrips supply, despite sustained investment in the UK.Competition for skills is increasing, with recent analysis showing that globally quantumjob adverts outstrip qualified talent by as much as three to one17, and salaries for topquantum professionals are more than double the UK average in the US.18"
61,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•Global investment and competition are increasing at a rapid pace and scale. The UK isworking within a changing geopolitical context with other governments ramping upinvestment into their national research programmes - with funding of at least $15 billionin China, and $7.2 billion in the European Union19, with the US now spending around$820 million a year,20 and Japan recently doubling its annual expenditure to around$590 million in 2022.21"
62,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,•Large corporations headquartered overseas have also established significant quantumprogrammes. This increase in activity means that UK companies face toughercompetition for talent and have to be aware of the potential risks associated withtechnology transfer and trade restrictions.
63,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Our Approach  The UK is in a strong position to play a world-leading role in quantum technologies, if we can overcome the challenges outlined above (many of which are shared by other nations). We have strategic choices about the approach we take across the different quantum technologies:  For quantum computing, our ambition is for the UK to support the development of and access to state-of-the-art and eventually fully scalable machines in order to explore beneficial applications for the economy and society and undertake research. At the same time this will give the UK quantum sector the best opportunity to capture a significant share of the global market creating jobs and delivering value to the UK economy. This means we must continue to develop UK strengths in quantum computing hardware, software and throughout the supply chain, which involves meeting significant engineering challenges.   Given the early stage of the technological development, and the fact that there are numerous platforms that could provide the path to developing a fully scalable machine, we will take a broad and ambitious approach to supporting quantum computing in the UK across the development of different hardware platforms, software, components, and all relevant supply chains. Although international collaboration will be an important part of our approach, it is not in the UK’s interests to sit back and rely purely on others for access to quantum computing hardware, so we will continue to develop UK strengths across the development of different hardware platforms, as well as software.  We will monitor the development of these technologies, both in the UK and in other countries, and the development of the market to ensure that we can flex our approach to deliver the best possible outcome for the UK.   For quantum sensing, timing and imaging, our ambition is to develop the technology so that the UK is in a strong position to play an important role globally in the next generation of sensors and position, navigation and timing (PNT) capabilities, working with international partners.   For quantum communications, our ambition is to realise both the potential of these technologies for secure communications where clear benefits can be demonstrated, as well as the opportunities they present for networking to help scale quantum computers, sharing information and addressing data storage challenges. Collaborating with international partners is a key element of this approach.  As quantum technologies develop and use cases are fully demonstrated, the UK will need to make key strategic decisions about where to focus efforts to realise the benefits from these technologies. At this early stage it is important to continue to build the science, grow the vibrant ecosystem, explore a range of technology platforms and parts of the supply chain where the UK has world leading strengths, in addition to focussing on software and use case exploration. But it is also important to be more targeted where and when we can, working with industry to accelerate development within high value applications as they emerge to grow a world-class quantum sector and deliver benefits for the economy and society.   We will therefore develop government actions over time within the wider programme based on progress and wider trends, in full consultation with the UK quantum community. We will report regularly to the National Science and Technology Council, chaired by the Prime Minister, and publish an annual report on progress.  This strategy sets out how we will put this approach into practice through domestic and international policy to achieve our vision and objectives for quantum technologies in the UK.  Ten-year vision and goals  Over the next ten years, we will build on our success to date by taking advantage of our world leading science and capabilities and supporting the continued growth of the UK’s quantum sector to realise the significant potential of quantum technologies for the economy.  Our ten-year vision is for the UK to be a world leading quantum-enabled economy, building on scientific excellence and creating a thriving quantum sector to ensure that quantum technologies are an integral part of the UK’s digital infrastructure and advanced manufacturing base, driving growth and helping to build a strong and resilient economy and society.  To realise this vision we will set four goals:  •Ensure the UK is home to world-leading quantum science and engineering, growing UKknowledge and skills"
64,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•Support business, making the UK the go-to place for quantum businesses and anintegral part of the global supply chain, as well as a preferred location for investors andglobal talent"
65,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•Drive the use of quantum technologies in the UK to deliver benefits for the economy, forsociety and for our national security"
66,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"•Create a national and international regulatory framework that supports innovation andthe ethical use of quantum technologies, and protects UK capabilities and nationalsecurity"
67,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"The government has published a Science and Technology Framework to build the UK into a Science and Technology Superpower, to help deliver stronger growth, better jobs, and bold discoveries to tackle the challenges of today and tomorrow.  The Science and Technology Framework has been designed in consultation with experts and practitioners across industry, academia and government to address the key challenges in delivering the UK’s Science and Technology Superpower ambitions. It represents commitment to a whole-of-government plan – introducing a truly systems approach to ensure policy, delivery, funding and messaging levers across traditional siloes are aligned and channelled to secure strategic advantage in S&T as a top UK priority. It includes boosting investment in research and development, building on the UK’s already enviable talent and skills base, investing in research and innovation infrastructure, ensuring we regulate in a way that supports innovation and growing technology sectors.   The Framework also sets out a more systematic way of identifying UK priority technologies, with the first five including quantum technologies (as well as AI, engineering biology, semiconductors, and future telecoms). As such, quantum technologies will benefit from the wider use of government levers set out in the Framework. This National Quantum Strategy therefore focuses on the quantum specific activities that the government or others need to undertake, in addition to wider government initiatives, to support the growth of the sector.  The following chapters set out how we will achieve each of our four goals."
68,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Goal 1: World-leading research and skills  We will ensure the UK is home to world-leading quantum science and engineering, growing UK knowledge and skills  Research and Development  The UK is the home to excellent science and innovation, and nowhere is this more true than in quantum technologies, where we already have an established programme of public and private R&D with over £1 billion of investment over the period 2014-2024.   The next phase of quantum R&D in the UK will be even greater in terms of ambition, scale and impact. It will focus on securing and building on our existing strengths, as well as exploring new areas of scientific endeavour. It will provide greater support to the work of our researchers and businesses to translate, demonstrate and commercialise quantum research, driving development in key areas with commercial, societal or security value. This will ensure that the UK is a global centre of excellence for the long term.   We will therefore establish a new and ambitious ten-year £2.5 billion quantum research and innovation programme from 2024-2034.   The future programme will be delivered in two 5-year phases, to be developed in full consultation with our partners across Government, most notably UKRI, independent expert advice and with industry. The core elements of the first 5-year phase will include:  •A new portfolio of applications-focussed Quantum Technology Research Hubs andCentres. These will build on the success that the existing hubs have had in building avibrant quantum research and innovation ecosystem. The future hubs will draw togetheractivities around a specific application area or theme, delivering strength and depth inquantum technologies and catalysing future growth and national capability. They willensure the UK is a global centre of excellence in cutting edge quantum science andtechnologies for the long term. These new Research Hubs or Centres will be formedfrom consortia of academic experts in quantum technologies and relevant disciplines,with additional collaborating partners from industry, government, or the third sector. Thehubs will also build the mechanisms needed to support the integration of theseemerging technologies into wider systems, led by end users."

75,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"We recognise the need to make a smooth transition from the current R&D programme to the new ten-year programme. The current phase of the programme will continue to deliver world leading research through all existing core elements until 2024. Over the next year we will consult widely on the specifics of the future programme and will also make additional investments within the existing programme to support the transition. These additional investments include:  •£100 million to continue to develop the existing application areas of computing,communications, sensing, imaging and timing through new quantum hub activities"
76,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,•£70 million in the development of two short-term quantum missions focussed onachieving key technological milestones around quantum computing and PNT.

81,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,2.Developing quantum computing test-beds – demonstrating the advantage of aquantum computer over a classical one through applications to underpin the growth ofa UK quantum computing sector capable of delivering quantum advantage in 2025.
82,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"For this investment of £2.5 billion we are expecting the private sector to commit to invest £1 billion into the programme over its lifetime. Up to now, we have achieved evenly matched industry funding from our innovation programmes. This takes account of direct contributions to programme activities only; the overall benefits and investment into the sector resulting from the programme will be much greater.  Skills  Access to the right skills and talent is essential for excellence in research, technology development and commercialisation. Building a diverse and thriving workforce that can drive the growing quantum industry will be vital to unlocking economic and societal benefits in the future. This requires highly skilled people – ensuring the UK has the researchers, engineers, innovators, and practitioners it needs to have a quantum-ready workforce. It means postgraduate training, the development of technical professionals and apprenticeships, and attraction and retention of world leading experts in the field.   The quantum sector is small but rapidly evolving, with an expectation that skills needs will change over time. The call for evidence responses told us we are facing challenges associated with the small global talent pool for quantum-specific talent. A recent survey found that the top challenge for businesses in preparing for quantum computing was being able to access the right skills and talent.22 Talent shortages also exist within the domestic sector itself according to UK-based companies."
83,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"The picture is similar internationally, with the US National Science and Technology Council finding that there is a skills shortage at all levels already, alongside a projected increase in demand in the future.23 Further to this, the wider STEM workforce that acts as a pipeline for future talent has been found to suffer from some persistent skill shortages and be less diverse than the wider workforce. Women make up just over a quarter of the STEM workforce,than the wider workforce. Women make up just over a quarter of the STEM workforce,than the wider workforce. Women make up just over a quarter of the STEM workforce,"
84,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"People and know-how are driving the early development of the emerging sector. We have provided strong support for growing the highly-specialised skills needed in the quantum sector since 2014. We have trained more than 470 doctoral students,Centres for Doctoral Training (CDTs), the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) and the National Physical Laboratory. We have also funded over 30 fellowships to support the brightest and the best to undertake their research in the UK, recognising the importance of academic freedom to do great things.25 including through the EPSRC’s 26  Fellowships  Quantum fellowships have been instrumental in nurturing early talent, providing access to specialist support and equipment, and allowing individuals to grow their international networks.  The success of these awards can be seen through the world class research and spinouts that have resulted from current and former fellows.  These include:  Joint EPSRC and NQCC scheme to support fellows to build their careers and deliver cutting-edge research in the UK   The EPSRC Open Fellowship supporting talented researchers across EPSRC’s portfolio  The UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship designed to develop the next generation of world-class researchers across universities, businesses and other R&D environments  STFC Ernest Rutherford Fellowships enabling early career researchers to establish a research programme  The UK has benefitted from attracting quantum talent from around the world. The UK’s points-based immigration system provides attractive routes for highly skilled people to move to the UK, including the high potential individual visa, scale-up visa, innovator visa, and the global talent visa. However, the visa system can sometimes act as a barrier to attracting highly talented individuals. We will work with partners across government to ensure that the immigration system allows companies and universities to attract the very top talent, who are in high demand in multiple countries."
85,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Visa routes  The government is updating the routes that talented individuals in the field of quantum can use to come to the UK and continue their careers. We will ensure that the quantum sector is able to make full use of this opportunity. Announced in the UK Innovation Strategy, these include:  The High Potential Individual Route make it as simple as possible for internationally mobile researchers who demonstrate high potential to come to the UK, based on graduation from an eligible top global university  A scale-up route, which allows talented individuals with an offer from a qualifying scale-up to come to the UK  And a revitalised Innovator route, which allows talented innovators and entrepreneurs to start and run a business in the UK that is either venture backed or innovative. This route is being refreshed to simplify and streamline its business eligibility criteria and build flexibility  The Global Talent visa route is open to those who are leaders or potential leaders in science and technology. Applicants must be endorsed by one of six endorsing bodies for the route, which include the Royal Society and UKRI, or have been awarded a prestigious prize. Applicants may qualify for endorsement if they have an eligible job offer, an individual fellowship or a research grant approved by UKRI."
86,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Building a quantum-literate workforce  As the sector scales, there will be a need for more emphasis on routes into the sector beyond doctoral training, as well as to build the pipeline from schools upwards. Professionalisation of quantum engineering skills will help talent to transition from adjacent sectors. To this end we will engage with UK professional bodies including the Institution of Engineering & Technology (IET) and the Institute of Physics (IoP) to develop awareness, skills and recognition of continuing professional development and careers in support of the quantum sector. Increasing quantum literacy and cross-fertilisation with domain expertise in the economy overall, particularly in key end-user sectors, is essential to growing the sector in the UK.    We recognise the need for more skilled technicians in the UK, a problem that is not unique to the quantum sector. These are the people who undertake skilled practical work with scientific or other equipment to enable the integration of quantum technologies into wider systems, often undertaking vocational or on the job training. The IoP found that over 50% of physics-related jobs do not require a degree27, indicating the potential scale of the role of vocational training. There are already successful initiatives to meet the technician need, such as the NPL"

94,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"International Partnerships  Quantum science and technologies are a global effort. We want to work with allies and partners to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes, whilst ensuring that the UK plays a leading role. We already take an open and collaborative approach to our quantum research, with recent international network calls run by EPSRC alone resulting in UK universities partnering with organisations in 28 countries.28  The Quantum Technologies for Fundamental Physics (QTFP) programme, which started in 2020, has generated twenty-six unique international links from its seven large consortia across 9 countries.29"
95,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Our aims for international engagement are to:  •Collaborate and share expertise with international partners on the opportunities,challenges and key uses of quantum, especially where technologies could help toachieve major societal goals (as set out in the Quantum Tech for Societal Goodsection)."

98,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"We are building collaborative relationships with a number of countries, such as under the Joint Statement of Intent with the US, which support mutually beneficial growth in our sectors. These will boost both research collaboration and connections between our industries. These relationships will also grow links between centres of excellence; running exchanges, workshops, and summer schools to support knowledge exchange; supporting intellectual property (IP) literacy; exploring missions or ‘grand challenges’ with leading countries around specific scientific breakthroughs or societal outcomes; and sharing access to key UK and international facilities.  We continue to engage informally with other leading nations on quantum, to support open collaboration and a pro-innovation regulatory approach, which will help to grow quantum sectors and supply chains. This allows us to exchange information on our national quantum programmes, opportunities and challenges and identify areas for future collaboration. We also work with a broad range of countries through multilateral fora, such as the OECD and the Global Technology Forum, the World Economic Forum, the G7, and NATO, and take advantage of broader collaborative R&D opportunities born out of defence pacts such as AUKUS.  International conversations on technical standards are at an early stage within standards development organisations such as the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association, International Organization for Standardization and International Electrotechnical Commission. We will work closely with industry, academia, civil society and with international partners to ensure UK interests are represented at key standards and wider international bodies.  To step up our international work on quantum we will:  •Expand our partnerships through a comprehensive programme of bilateralarrangements with leading quantum nations, working with the UK’s global Science andInnovation Network, and considering the priorities and outcomes set in the forthcomingUK International Tech Strategy."

NPL and NIST have agreed a formal collaborate on both R&D and standards development around quantum technologies. This collaboration act as a nucleus, growing to include other US laboratories and international partners.   Joint research exchanges between UK and US partners will also be supported by NPL and EPSRC, beginning with summer schools in 2023 that also involve Canadian participants. Goal 2: Supporting Business  Support business, making the UK the go-to place for quantum businesses and an integral part of the global supply chain, as well as a preferred location for investors and global talent  The UK quantum sector  The UK has a thriving quantum ecosystem which provides huge opportunities to translate ideas into economic value and societal impact. There are already at least 160 companies active in the UK’s quantum sector,30 and our quantum companies have attracted more disclosed private equity investment than any other European country, second only to the US globally.31 The UK quantum ecosystem is comprised primarily of SMEs which operate in specific areas of expertise. This means collaboration is an essential part of the UK ecosystem - within the sector as well as with academia, allied sectors and user communities - and needs to be a fundamental part of our strategy going forwards."
105,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"UK start-up Quantum Motion raises £42m to scale activities  In February 2023, London based start-up Quantum Motion raised over £42m in equity funding from some of the world’s leading quantum investors (Quantum Insider). Quantum Motion are developing scalable quantum computers using existing silicon manufacturing processes. The funding round was led by Robert Bosch Venture Capital and supported by British Patient Capital, among other investors. The increasing frequency of larger UK investment rounds reflects progress technology development and an increasing awareness and confidence in the potential of quantum technologies.  We will ensure that the UK’s start-ups and SMEs can thrive in the UK. The growth of the sector is reliant on a steady flow of newcomers into the ecosystem and the ability of SMEs to grow their quantum business quickly and accelerate the development of their technology. The UK’s start-ups also require continued support to manage the challenging “valley of death” stage of commercialisation, where products are still in the development cycle and the company is not yet making revenue. Success is dependent on a critical mass of companies as well as the ability of people, knowledge, and ideas to flow in and out of this ecosystem from surrounding industries, users, and academia. Enabling all of this to happen will be critical to securing the UK’s position as a global quantum innovation hub."
106,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Working hand in hand with the quantum sector  Growing the quantum sector in the UK will be a truly collaborative endeavour over the next ten years and beyond as the sector takes shape, with sufficient time, resource and effort dedicated to the task. We will work closely with quantum companies as well as key industry and professional bodies such as UKQuantum, the Institute of Physics, the Royal Academy of Engineering, the Institute of Engineering and Technology and techUK to make sure that industry views are understood and that government actions support growth. This engagement will cover areas such as the detailed design of the future R&D programme, skills, quantum readiness across the wider economy, international engagement, and the co-design of future regulation and standards.  Commercialisation and Accelerators  As outlined in the previous section, missions for quantum computing and PNT will include enabling activities to support commercialisation and user adoption in these technology areas. In addition, we will develop new acceleration programmes for quantum technologies that will support the sector to capitalise on market opportunities and build strategic advantage for the UK.   Acceleration programmes will help to speed commercialisation, industrialisation, and linking the sector to end-users by focussing on systems integration, applications, and real-world demonstrations. They will build on, and expand, existing activities being delivered by the NQTP partners and enable greater participation from the growing UK sector. The specific investments and activities of an accelerator programme will be tailored to the technology areas and will include efforts to roadmap the route to market for key applications. We will continue to engage the community to help shape these programmes.   We will also continue industry-led innovation funding opportunities, such as that provided via the ISCF quantum challenge. This will help de-risk investments over the medium to long-term and encourage new entrants to join the sector. The ISCF has an impressive track record of helping companies to secure investment alongside grant agreements, as well as helping to grow the pipeline of new start-ups through feasibility studies.   Infrastructure  The UK’s quantum facilities and centres of excellence are spread across all regions of the country. We have made significant investments in government-owned infrastructure to support industry and the development of new products based on quantum technologies. This includes expanding the facilities and capabilities at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington and establishing the National Quantum Computing Centre at the Harwell Campus in Oxfordshire. This is in addition to the network of research and innovation infrastructure built up in the existing Quantum Technology Research Hubs, and investment in wider capabilities such as the the the the the the the  Scotland photonics cluster  Scotland has a vibrant and long established sector in the field of photonic technologies, with an annual industrial turn-over of over £1.2 billion (Technology Scotland), which in turn has led it to be an important region for quantum technology development in the UK. The Quantum Technology cluster in Scotland promotes itself as Glentanglement®.  The region is marked by the emergence and growth of innovative start-ups, leading manufacturers (such as Coherent Scotland and M Squared), and large defence systems integrators with strong laser and radar divisions. This is combined with a world-class research base, with several universities having extensive legacies in lasers and photonics as well as in quantum optics and cold atom work.  The cluster is also supported by other leading research & development and innovation centres such as the James Watt Nanofabrication Centre based at the University of Glasgow, and the Li-Fi Centre at the University of Strathclyde.  Helping to tie the ecosystem together is the Fraunhofer Centre for Applied Photonics UK, a world-leading centre in applied laser research and development, based at the University of Strathclyde.  The network of institutions in the Central Belt is closely tied to the NQTP, notably through the Quantum Imaging Hub (QuantIC) led by the University of Glasgow (partnered in Scotland with the Universities of Edinburgh, Heriot-Watt and Strathclyde), but with the other three of the UK’s quantum technology hubs also having a strong presence in university physics departments in Scotland. Almost half of all Government-supported Commercialising Quantum Technologies Programme projects involve a Scottish organisation participant (UK Quantum Technologies Challenge, The Directory, UKRI)."

Leading-edge university researchers have been brought together with high-tech companies focused on delivering market-ready products with critical application in quantum technologies.   This activity has been underpinned by the UKRI Strength in Places Fund through the establishment of centres of excellence, such as the Institute for Compound Semiconductors and a Future CS Manufacturing Hub, both located at Cardiff University, and the Centre for Integrated Semiconductor Materials at Swansea University. Exploitation across the supply chain is facilitated by research translation entities such as The CS Centre and The CS Applications Catapult.  The industrial activity is driven by the presence of expanding global leaders: IQE, the market leader in supply of advanced compound semiconductor materials; KLA, a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, inspection and metrology tools, and Microchip Technology, a leading provider of mixed-signal and analogue semiconductor products.  The NQTP seeks to build on this regional excellence. To date the cluster has been a UK manufacturing source for novel quantum components, and is the coordinator of the UK National Quantum Foundry.   The next ten years of innovation will require access to the right research and innovation infrastructure to test, pilot and demonstrate the value of these technologies in the laboratory and real-world settings so that we can accelerate their path to market.   The government has a role to play in providing critical infrastructure where access to equipment or facilities provides shared benefits. This includes, for example, facilities for testing and evaluation of technologies, which in turn builds confidence in system integrators, end-users, investors, and the manufacturers themselves. It also includes large national scale infrastructure for demonstrating the value of technologies in real world settings. This might include the development of future quantum networks with the ability to distribute quantum information and quantum-based references such as timing signals around the country between key locations. The commercialisation of quantum technologies, as well as other inter-related technologies such as semiconductors, is also likely to require fabrication facilities, and we will look at the different options for providing additional support in this area.

121,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Investment to unleash innovation  To develop a globally competitive quantum technologies sector we must ensure UK companies can access finance at all stages of growth. Quantum technologies can require large amounts of investment before they produce a return and have lengthy research and development cycles to reach the market, requiring more patient capital than some other technology sectors. Later funding rounds will be key to enable companies to scale-up and expand their manufacturing capabilities as technologies reach the market. This challenge is particularly important for quantum computing companies due to the large capital requirements for developing and scaling hardware.  The UK is a great place for businesses to access the funding they need for innovation. During 2022, fast-growing UK tech companies continued to raise at near-record levels (£24 billion), more than France (£11.8 billion) and Germany (£9.1 billion) combined. This takes the total raised over the past five years to nearly £100 billion (£97 billion).32"
122,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"The government remains committed to its long-term objective to mobilising more institutional investment into productive areas of the economy, ensuring that savers stand to benefit from the growth of the UK’s most innovative companies.  We are taking action to deliver this objective and meet the 2019 manifesto commitment to ‘unlock long-term capital in pension funds to invest in and commercialise our scientific discoveries, creating a vibrant science-based economy post-Brexit’.  The government is legislating to implement important regulatory changes such as reform of the pensions regulatory charge cap, which will provide clarity for industry and ensure pension savers stand to benefit from higher potential investment returns. We continue to engage closely with industry stakeholders to develop the most effective policies to support this objective.  Government finance mechanisms  The British Business Bank is an important delivery partner in our efforts to make finance markets for smaller businesses work more effectively, allowing those businesses to prosper, grow and build UK economic activity. Up to the end of 2020, the Bank had supported the provision of £42 billion worth of finance to 170,000 small and medium-sized businesses across the UK, not including its COVID-19 debt and equity finance schemes (UK Innovation Strategy).  The Bank provides access to scaling capital at larger, later-stage funding rounds, through British Patient Capital (BPC) which, since its launch in 2018, has become the largest domestic investor in UK venture and venture growth funds (BPC). Its long-term investment approach helps UK companies access the right type of funding at the right time in their life cycle and is intended to demonstrate that a patient investment approach –which can support deeptech companies – can produce commercially attractive returns. The British Business Bank has also launched Future Fund: Breakthrough, a £375 million UK-wide programme that will co-invest alongside private investors directly in later funding rounds at high-growth, innovative firms. The programme will focus on R&D intensive companies and will aim to accelerate the deployment of breakthrough technologies which can transform major industries, develop new medicines, and support the UK transition to a net zero economy.  Technology is a focus area for the Future Fund: Breakthrough programme, with BPC seeing quantum computing as a future technology which has the potential to revolutionise a multitude of sectors, cementing the UK’s position at the forefront of global innovation. BPC have invested in Oxford Quantum Circuits’ £38m Series A funding round through its Future Fund: Breakthrough programme (BPC)."
123,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"The National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) is the Government’s corporate venture capital arm for dual-use advanced technologies. NSSIF invests commercially in advanced technology firms, alongside other investors, to support long-term equity investment. Because they co-invest, every pound they invest is leveraged by private investment. NSSIF’s quantum strategy aims to support a thriving UK ecosystem and deliver early quantum advantage for national security and defence. Through British Technology Investments Limited, which acts as NSSIF's direct investment arm, NSSIF has made direct investments in quantum technology companies. In addition, it has broad exposure to a range of other quantum firms via its indirect ‘fund-of-funds’ investments.  Growing global supply chains  The supply chain that underpins the quantum sector – whilst still nascent – is already truly global. Based on a survey of 54 relevant UK companies, 85% are importing elements of their supply chain to develop quantum technologies.33 UK companies are a key part of this global supply chain."

125,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Attracting quantum businesses to the UK  Much of the UK quantum business sector is formed from homegrown talent, nurtured through our universities and quantum hubs or established in larger UK companies. There is also an important place for quantum companies from overseas in the UK ecosystem. The UK is already an attractive location due to our strengths in quantum science, our supply chain, our wider business-friendly environment, our support for innovation and our talented quantum skills base. For example, the recent return of quantum computing firm PsiQuantum to the UK, with the establishment of a quantum computing research centre in Daresbury in the North-West of England, demonstrated confidence in the competitiveness of the UK’s quantum sector. In 2021, IBM worked with the government to establish the Hartree National Centre for Digital Innovation, which brings together world-leading expertise in AI and quantum computing to support their application in industry and the public sector.

126,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Goal 3: Driving the adoption of Quantum Technologies in the UK  Drive the adoption of quantum technologies in the UK to deliver benefits for the economy, society and for national security  If the UK is to reap their full benefits, all sectors of the economy must understand the opportunities from quantum technologies. Industry, researchers, and the public sector will need to understand and explore how they can utilise quantum technologies to do things differently, or even doing things that currently aren't possible. This is challenging in an emerging sector where it is not always clear exactly how or when quantum technologies will offer a competitive advantage.  A recent EY report found that only 25-33% of businesses had taken concrete steps to prepare for the arrival of quantum computing, despite 48% believing quantum computing will play an important role in their industries by 2025.34"
127,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"We will raise awareness of the opportunities and foster the right connections to build an understanding of user needs. We will set direction and providing a signal of intent by focussing efforts on where quantum will deliver the most value for the UK. Below we have set out some of these areas of opportunity that relate to net zero, national security, health, digital innovation and critical growth sectors – particularly those relating to the other four technologies of tomorrow (AI, future telecoms, semiconductors and engineering biology).   In previous chapters we have set out our missions-based approach which will galvanise research and innovation activities towards a defined societal benefit. The two tech missions in PNT and computing will be important testing ground for more ambitious future missions, which will include a focus on those applications that will have the greatest impact to drive early adoption in key sectors, such as financial services and life sciences. Developing testbeds for different hardware platforms is a focus of the current computing mission and we will look to expand these efforts as the technology develops.   Bridging the gap between nascent technology development and end user applications will be an important role for the NQCC, with the potential for ambitious missions to drive largescale testing across selected sectors. This work will be supported by expanded government procurement activities, such as the Catalyst Fund set out later in this chapter, which will concentrate on pairing the capabilities of quantum with the government’s biggest challenges."

129,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"An environmentally sustainable and resilient UK: By mimicking nature a quantum computer could simulate new materials, accelerate improvements in solar panels and batteries, and help improve the efficiency of renewable energy sources. By modelling and optimizing logistics and traffic network flows, quantum computing could reduce carbon emissions as well as bring about significant efficiency savings. Meanwhile, by monitoring the emission of greenhouse gases, quantum sensors could help the UK to meet emissions targets and monitor compliance.  Strengthened security, defence and resilience at home and overseas: By solving complex optimisation problems, and sending information in a quantum state we could improve sensor networks for defence purposes and enable autonomy through enhanced sensors. We could use quantum-enhanced machine learning for pattern matching, image and voice recognition and classification, and data fusion. The use of quantum computing and sensing on the battlefield could enable us to find targets of interest and enhance situational awareness. Quantum computers could solve complex calculations for modelling and improving performance on the battlefield. Short and long-range quantum communication systems may provide high bandwidth, secure point-to-point communications which cannot be intercepted and can be covert on deployable platforms. Quantum sensing, timing and imaging capabilities could provide the next generation of  PNT capabilities to support troops on deployment, including in built-up urban environments where access to current systems is challenging.  The UK as a world leader in health and life sciences: By solving complex logistical problems, quantum computing could help make hospital systems more efficient, improving delivery and reducing costs. Quantum computing could also analyse vast and unstructured data sets to speed up new drug development timelines and reduce costs. Better, cheaper or easier imaging will enable improved diagnostics and outcomes for patients, for example, for use during cancer surgery to remove damaged tissue, or to monitor epilepsy in children, or brain damage and concussion.  The UK as a meaningful digital actor and unlocking the power of data for the UK: By accelerating optimization routines, quantum computing could enhance scenario planning, logistics and risk management within financial systems. Quantum computers may accelerate machine learning and provide reinforcement learning using unbiased data sets. Quantum technologies could act as an enabler for the further development of smart cities through sensing, networking and compute capabilities.   Supporting other UK priority technologies and sectors: As enabling technologies, quantum products and services will often unlock innovation through integration of a wider suite of technological solutions. Given the breadth of anticipated capabilities and advances in performance, they will also have applications across many sectors. This represents both a great opportunity and a challenge for commercialisation. Considerable work is required to understand the drivers and technological challenges within critical sectors of the economy. This includes future telecoms networks, the space, defence, health, AI, high performance computing, photonics and semiconductor industries. We must ensure that efforts to roadmap and support technological advances within other sectors are mindful of what quantum could offer and develop an integrated whole system approach, enabling suitable environments within which to test and demonstrate applications. Substantial work will also be required to integrate new quantum technologies into existing systems of classical technologies and to assure their capabilities.  Quantum computing, high performance computing, AI and cloud computing: the case for convergence  As quantum computing develops, we will need to take every advantage of synergies between capabilities and opportunities in other technologies. As set out in the independent review of the Future of Compute, high performance computing is required in the UK to accelerate and steer the development of frontier AI in a manner aligned with the UK’s values and objectives. Over the next ten years, quantum computing will be an important addition to the UK’s high performance computing ecosystem, where integrated hybrid solutions are likely to be critical to achieving the best results. Meanwhile, cloud access and orchestration of resources has the potential to make compute, including quantum computing, more accessible to a broad range of users.   The NQCC is already supporting convergence through exploring quantum machine learning applications and identifying mechanisms for cloud access to quantum computing for UK industry and researchers. Work will also be undertaken to further understanding of the quantum sector’s needs for advanced computing capabilities and how we can meet the integration challenges.   Given the early stage of technology development for quantum computing, awareness raising and upskilling users to explore potential use cases is challenging. But the requirement to engage early is critical. The NQCC will play a crucial role in raising awareness and improving readiness, as well as providing test beds and access to compute to enable use case exploration."
130,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"NQCC test bed for quantum computing applications  The NQCC has developed an extensive programme of support for users under the SparQ Applications Discovery Programme, to help them understand the opportunities associated with quantum computing, including training programmes and hackathons. The programme is ensuring resources are in place to provide access to state-of-the-art quantum compute resources delivered via the cloud, applications expertise, sharing of best practise and technical support to help shape and drive industry adoption.  Furthermore, the NQCC will ensure test beds are developed and supported to enable the UK quantum computing developer community. These will be a mix of hosted hardware for end user access, state-of-the-art cloud services and well characterised stable platforms with full stack access to support developers in understanding error causality, mitigation and correction on the road towards large-scale fault tolerant machines of the future. The NQCC along with the Quantum Software Laboratory at the University of Edinburgh will investigate emerging use cases with societal impact. The NQCC will also examine key challenges around scaling quantum computing machines; verification, benchmarking, and error correction.   SparQ Applications Discovery Programme  The SparQ programme, developed by the National Quantum Computing Centre (NQCC), will help UK-based companies and researchers in the early exploration of applications for quantum computing. The NQCC is teaming up with Oxford Quantum Circuits (OQC) amongst others, to provide businesses and researchers with access to quantum compute resources including emulators, simulators, annealers and gate-based quantum computing platforms.  While many government and research institutions around the world have developed programs aimed at raising awareness about quantum, SparQ goes further to take industry and government users through a journey from awareness, to engagement, evaluation, action and advocacy supported through four key elements: access to quantum computers, technical support and applications expertise, workshops and networking opportunities and learning resources. These elements are all aimed at allowing potential users to gain early hands-on experience in working with quantum hardware and algorithms to address challenges that are relevant to industry. Critically, the program is not just for quantum computer scientists and researchers, but also industry end users – people who are most likely to take quantum know-how and turn it into real world applications."
131,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Leading by example through government signalling and procurement  There are many areas where quantum technologies could improve public service delivery and enhance government’s capabilities – from improving the way we monitor climate change from space, to providing the ability to sense underground objects to speed up major infrastructure projects.   Government can act as an early adopter of emerging technologies to support technology development and demonstrate the value of technologies to other sectors of the economy. There are numerous examples where procurement has been used to drive innovation such as through the Small Business Research Initiative (SBRI) and the National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF), providing public service improvements for the government whilst supporting small businesses and stimulating markets. As part of NSSIF’s strategy, and to deliver insight and access to quantum computing for government, NSSIF has deployed £2.6m in R&D contracts with quantum companies, helping to stimulate growth in the UK quantum ecosystem.  Defence is a key area where the government acts as an early adopter of emerging technologies. The MOD was a key partner in setting up the NQTP in 2014.  MOD has identified key quantum technology applications for defence, including sensing, imaging, and timing, as well as subsequent near-term opportunities in communications and computing. MOD has shared its own novel S&T with the NQTP, while in turn drawing on the expertise within the programme. This has allowed the department to assess future challenges, understand applications and routes to exploitation, and ensure Defence is ‘quantum ready’.   The MOD Science & Technology Strategy also outlines the government’s intention to be an understanding first customer, an early adopter of innovation and a customer that’s prepared to take some risk – taking relatively immature technologies and experimenting with them within Defence systems. MOD will send clear messages to quantum innovators and potential collaborators on the military challenges identified which may be addressed by quantum technologies, while also welcoming and encouraging novel ideas and opportunities that Defence may not have yet identified. Government will work across departments to explore other key public sector applications and consider how other departments can learn from this example.

To prepare for future challenges, it is important to engage early in the debates that will shape future regulation through national and international fora where early work is underway to identify potential risks associated with the use of new technologies, and to develop shared taxonomies, languages, and principles to guide their future development. Eventually new standards, benchmarking and assurance frameworks will increase in importance to facilitate technological development as use cases become more evident, helping to set requirements for interoperability and to measure performance within key sectors.  As the quantum sector evolves both nationally and internationally, we must anticipate and prepare for future regulatory challenges.

The strength of the UK quantum sector attracts interest from hostile states who seek to develop their own capabilities or undermine ours. We continue to welcome trade and investment while ensuring that we protect the UK effectively from malicious practices which could have a damaging impact on our security and prosperity."

152,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Key regulatory frameworks  Government guidance for academia (“Trusted Research”) and industry ( “Secure Innovation”), as well as wider advice1 is available through NPSA and NCSC. They seek to support the sector in navigating nuanced risks around state threats and the risks to collaboration, through a better understanding of due diligence on partners, identification of high-risk research or organisational key assets alongside appropriate security governance and risk management, which allows those organisations to make risk-based decisions about how to balance security with opportunity. This includes advice on undertaking security audits and mitigations with accredited risk consultants.  The Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS)  ATAS applies to all international students and researchers (apart from exempt nationalities) who are subject to UK immigration control and are intending to study or research at postgraduate level in certain sensitive subjects.  The subjects and research areas are those where knowledge could be used in programmes to develop Advanced Conventional Military Technology (ACMT), weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) or their means of delivery. Researchers and students in these sensitive subjects must apply for an Academic Technology Approval Scheme (ATAS) certificate before they can study or start research in the UK.  The National Security and Investment Act (NSIA) (2021)  The NSIA came into force on 4 January 2022, and gives the government powers to scrutinise and intervene in business acquisitions, such as takeovers, that may pose national security risks.

As is often the case for less mature developing technologies, there are few specific controls targeting quantum technologies themselves or the goods designed for research and development of such technologies. It is possible new controls may be introduced in the future as the technologies mature and their impacts are understood.  Mitigating the risks associated with quantum  As with any new technology, risks associated with the use of quantum technologies will continue to emerge. One of the most well documented is the risk quantum computing will pose to national cyber security in the future by threatening the security of much of the existing public-key cryptography, upon which the information sharing and trust mechanisms of most modern systems depend.   The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) is the UK’s authority for cyber security and cryptography and has published guidance on the transition to quantum-safe cryptography, which is the recommended mitigation against this threat once products become available.  In terms of Government’s own preparedness, mitigations have already been put in place for critical information and services.  NCSC will continue to give bespoke advice to each sector through its resilience teams, and general advice on quantum-safe cryptography via its website. More detailed guidance for quantum-safe cryptography algorithms will follow the outcome of the NIST process, recommending specific algorithms for representative use cases.  NCSC’s guidance for mitigating the risks from quantum computing is set out within the White Paper “Preparing for Quantum Safe Cryptography”.  NCSC’s position is that robust and secure transition will take time to plan and deliver, and there is risk in beginning transition to quantum-safe cryptography before standards-compliant products are available.  NCSC works with international partners to ensure our plans and guidance for transition to quantum-safe cryptography are aligned.  There are actions organisations can and should take now to manage that risk.  Any organisation that manages their own cryptographic infrastructure should factor quantum-safe transition into their long-term plans and conduct investigatory work to identify which of their systems will be high priority for transition once standards-compliant implementations exist. Priority systems could be those that process sensitive personal data, or the parts of the public-key infrastructure that have certificate expiry dates far into the future and would be hardest to replace.  Technical Standards  The importance of standards is growing with the increasing globalisation of commerce, the emergence of new technologies and the need for interoperability. As technology progresses from initial research to prototype and product development technical standards become increasingly important, for example by supporting the consistent measurement of technology performance.  Different types of standards activity will be relevant at different levels of maturity: from identifying critical measurements and taxonomies as part of basic research, to the metrics and benchmarking of prototypes, and the interoperability and certification of commercial quantum products. Different quantum technologies are likely to mature at different rates.  While supporting the development of standards will be important to advancing open technological development, interoperability and trade, these activities need to take place at the right time to avoid stifling innovation by setting boundaries and requirements too early in the process. There is also a need to mitigate the risks of standards being developed by those who do not share our values and in a way that does not support the UK economy. Engagement with key stakeholders and experts in specific areas of quantum technology research and innovation will be critical to Government developing an understanding of this balance.  There are a number of early quantum standardisation activities taking place globally with significant focus on quantum safe cryptography and QKD, with UK leadership in these areas. Standards development organisations with activity on quantum technology include: International Organization for Standardization (ISO); International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC); International Telecommunication Union (ITU); Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF); the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI);  and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).  We will:  •Work through relevant global bodies to ensure that global quantum technical standardspromote our prosperity and security interests, including accelerating commercialisationof quantum technologies and supporting the sector here in the UK"

Relevant industry, and academia will be engaged in these efforts to track priority standards activity, raise stakeholder awareness and develop roadmaps to support UK engagement with quantum standards development."
154,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"Existing UK governance of quantum technical standards  Quantum computing, quantum communications, quantum imaging and quantum sensors and timing are at different stages of standardisation activity and spread across several different International Standards Development Organisations (SDOs). The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has raised awareness of relevant standards activity amongst the Research Hubs, and has initiated engagement with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the US.  The British Standards Institute (BSI) coordinates UK engagement in quantum standards activity at ISO/IEC and at the European level in CEN/CENELEC. A BSI committee for quantum standards was established with NPL support in March 2021. So far its main activity has been to mirror and contribute to ISO/IEC/JTC 1/WG 14, Quantum Computing, and to the CEN/CENELEC Focus Group on Quantum Technologies (FGQT).  Within government DSIT is responsible for quantum technology policy and for policy on digital technical standards, which includes standards for quantum and related technologies such as AI and telecommunications. Standards oversight and leadership will be provided by DSIT through partnership with NPL and BSI, bringing in other key organisations such as NCSC and NQCC in their particular fields.  Assurance of quantum technologies  Users of quantum technologies and other emerging technologies require some confirmation of the reliability, cost effectiveness, safety and security of the products or services that they want to acquire. Testing and evaluation as well as wider assurance plays a critical role in demonstrating that the technologies do what they say they will.   It is too early in the development pathway of many quantum technologies to establish full assurance frameworks for their use, however extensive work has been undertaken at NPL and elsewhere to develop effective testing and evaluation techniques, working with industry through ISCF Quantum Challenge projects and their Quantum Testing and Evaluation (QTE) Programme. This will stand them in good stead for the development of future frameworks.   The NQCC and the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) are also working to develop open standards that build on benchmarking tools commissioned by the NQCC to enable comparisons to be drawn between competing quantum platforms. NPL and NQCC will develop an assurance and benchmarking programme of work to sit alongside the standards roadmap.  Security assurance is as important as performance assurance to provide users with the confidence to invest in or adopt these technologies. As such, good security principles established by NCSC and set out in the Cyber Security Strategy 2022 should be adhered to and security must be seen as an enabler rather than an inhibitor or commercial success. By reducing cyber risks in their interactions with other businesses or users via the cloud, as well as ensuring quantum technologies are secure by design, quantum companies can maximise the economic benefits associated with quantum technologies. As set out in the Cyber Security Strategy, NCSC will work with the National Quantum Technologies Programme to develop a security model for quantum computers, which will help companies to design secure architectures, building on the Digital Security by Design programme and will continue to offer guidance to quantum companies to help them to operate safely on the cloud."
155,3,UK,2023,National Quantum Strategy,"The Quantum Metrology Institute at the National Physical Laboratory  The Quantum Metrology Institute (QMI) at NPL was established in 2015 as part of the first phase of the National Quantum Technologies Programme. The QMI brings together all NPL’s capabilities in science, metrology and major facilities relevant to the understanding, development and test of quantum technologies. The QMI is a national capability for test and evaluation, accelerating the commercialisation of quantum technologies.  NPL teams work in collaboration with industry and academic partners across the country focused on multiple scientific areas including quantum clocks, quantum communications, quantum computing, quantum sensors and quantum materials. Facilities are available to test and characterise materials, components and systems from the full range of technology areas.  NPL offers schemes for industry to access these facilities and opportunities to collaborate with NPL scientists and engineers to address barriers to innovation, reliability and scaling of quantum systems.  To expand these national capabilities in support of the quantum economy, a new facility – the Advanced Quantum Metrology Laboratory (AQML) – has been constructed on the NPL Teddington site. The AQML will give NPL even greater capacity to support the UK in the successful commercialisation and adoption of quantum technologies Conclusion  The potential benefits and opportunities of quantum technologies are vast and will offer advantages to the UK in meeting our economic, security, climate, health and societal aims. We are in a strong position to be a world-leading quantum nation, but we must continue to be bold and ambitious in our approach if we are to capitalise on our strengths and bolster our position in the global race.   This strategy set out our deep long-term commitment to quantum technologies in the UK and the actions we will take to build on our advantages across a broad range of quantum technologies.   To conclude, we will ensure that the UK is a leading quantum nation, building on the years of investment and progress already made in the vibrant UK quantum ecosystem. We will invest – at scale and over the long-term – in the cutting-edge science and the people who will deliver our success. We will support our quantum businesses who are driving the commercialisation of the technology and ensuring that the ideas and knowledge are translated into products and services that can be used across the economy to deliver benefits to all our citizens. We will work internationally to share and increase knowledge, build secure supply chains and collaborate on the most pro-innovation and ethical global governance and regulation of quantum technologies.  In the words of the Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology, ‘We will make the UK the home for cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs, the best place in the world to start and grow a quantum business, a leading voice in the international quantum and tech community, and a magnet for international quantum talent.’  At this relatively early stage in the development of quantum technologies, our approach is to strengthen the entire quantum ecosystem, by applying all the levers that the government has available. As the technology matures, and the successful technical solutions in particular areas become clearer, our programme might need to change and become more tailored. Engaging with the UK quantum community to understand what is working, and how the support needs to adapt, will be an essential part of our approach. We will consult widely on the design of the future programme.   Implementation  To achieve this ambitious programme of work we will bring a rigorous approach to implementation and delivery. This will be a collaborative effort across Government, academia and industry, and with our international partners. A new Office for Quantum will be the engine of our ambition, based in DSIT but integrating knowledge and expertise from across the community and will:"

2,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"under the  COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE  of the  NATIONAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY COUNCIL  SEPTEMBER 2018  Quantum information science: the next technological revolution  Quantum information science (QIS) applies the best understanding of the sub-atomic world—quantum theory—to generate new knowledge and technologies. Through developments in QIS, the United States can improve its industrial base, create jobs, and provide economic and national security benefits. Prior examples of QIS-related technologies include semiconductor microelectronics, photonics, the global positioning system (GPS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These underpin significant parts of the national economic and defense infrastructure. Future scientific and technological discoveries from QIS may be even more impactful. Long-running U.S. Government investments in QIS and more recent industry involvement have transformed this scientific field into a nascent pillar of the American research and development enterprise. The Trump administration is committed to maintaining and expanding American leadership in QIS to enable future long-term benefits from, and protection of, the science and technology created through this research. Based on the collective input of all the Government agencies invested or interested in QIS, this document presents a national strategic approach to achieving this goal.  Specifically, the United States will create a visible, systematic, national approach to quantum information research and development, organized under a single brand and coordinated by the National Science and Technology Council’s (NSTC) Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science (SCQIS). These efforts will leverage existing programs and approaches, adapt to the changing and improving scientific and technical knowledge, reflect the best understanding of opportunities and challenges in QIS for the Nation, and take new steps where appropriate.

35,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"Challenges this strategic overview addresses  The rapid growth of QIS and the expectation that this trajectory will continue over the next decade create unique opportunities and challenges for the U.S. research and development enterprise. Underscoring the Trump Administration’s commitment to advancing QIS, the NSTC elevated its work on the subject and established the SCQIS, which has identified four key challenges that need to be addressed with a whole-of-Government response.  First, improving and facilitating coordination both within the Government and between public and private institutions will create a robust domestic ecosystem and provide worldwide leadership in this international environment. The Nation already has strong and diverse programs in QIS at the Federalagency level driven by individual mission spaces, as described in the Appendix. Similarly, companies have begun making major investments in the field, inspired by the promise of future applications. At the same time, foreign countries are making investments and seeking to build their own QIS base in competition with the United States. Coordinating U.S. efforts will take advantage of the Government and industry activities to maintain and accelerate U.S. leadership in QIS.  Second, growth within industry, academia, and Government requires maintaining and expanding a broad and viable workforce—a quantum-smart workforce—able to enact critical elements of the research and development enterprise. Such a workforce will attract and retain key jobs throughout the Nation, and enable new industrial and academic efforts that rely upon QIS as a base technology.  Third, future progress in QIS requires strong cross-community connections between disciplines, from physics to computer science to engineering. These interactions already occur through research collaborations, but would benefit further from formal interdisciplinary research and training programs at earlier levels of education. As growth continues, collaborations and cooperation—between disciplines and nations, between industry and academia—must be promoted, even as competitive pressures may make this more difficult.  Fourth, significant uncertainty remains regarding the overall economic and national security impact of QIS research and development. With strong industrial engagement now beginning, it is crucial to maintain a culture of discovery. The likely best-use commercial cases of quantum devices are unknown at this time and must be found through research. Maintaining this focus, despite significant countervailing pressures, is necessary. The technologies that are anticipated to result from this approach may also play a role in solutions to some of the Nation’s most pressing national security concerns, but will require maintaining an understanding of national security implications of QIS.  In order to maintain and expand American leadership in this critical technology given these challenges, we must improve our capacity for cutting edge research and development, expand the QIS-literate workforce, and seamlessly coordinate between government, academic, and private sector players.  4 Choosing a science-first approach to QIS  Quantum information science—including concepts and technology that support revolutionary advances in computing, communications, and metrology—arises from a synthesis of quantum mechanics and information theory. It examines uniquely quantum phenomena that can be harnessed to advance information processing, transmission, measurement, and fundamental understanding in ways that classical approaches can only do much less efficiently, or not at all. Current and future QIS applications differ from prior applications of quantum mechanics, such as the laser, transistor and MRI, by using distinct quantum phenomena—superposition and entanglement—that do not have classical counterparts.  Even though its origins can be traced back to the 1960’s, QIS remains a rapidly evolving scientific and engineering discipline with substantial further discovery opportunities awaiting. This reflects the Government’s long support of basic research and development in this field. Even now, while prototype QIS applications, platforms and devices are becoming commercially available, new applications and platforms will likely come from protocols and approaches that are not yet invented. Thus, the Government should maintain robust and diverse platforms and research thrusts that continue to stimulate transformative and fundamental scientific discoveries by taking an approach that puts the science first. This will require strengthening core research programs and finding new methods to broaden collaboration and participation.   To capitalize on QIS-inspired technologies and advance the science necessary to realize the associated gains, the development and pursuit of scientific and applied Grand Challenges will be the unifying strategy. Grand Challenges are those fundamental scientific or technology problems with answers that will be transformative for Nation and have broad economic and scientific impact. Potential solutions will take sustained investments for at least ten years and require multidisciplinary teams of researchers and technologists. Agencies, academia, and industry must work together to identify and prioritize Grand Challenges, as well as track their progress and reevaluate these scientific and technological opportunities as the research and development progress.  Solving Grand Challenges and realizing  the potential of QIS will depend on employing effective models of coordination and collaboration to tap the unique skills and perspectives from Federal agencies, industry, and academia, and to create and maintain a dialogue between quantum-focused researchers across disciplines. Towards this end, centers and consortia can be a powerful means of gathering and maintaining research communities that can sustain such long-term, curiosity-driven research. In addition, the SCQIS’s coordination role as well as mechanisms such as professional science and engineering society participation, coordinated Principal Investigator meetings, and dissemination of information through scientific journals, will help to highlight and share quantum scientific advances and to grow the quantum research  Grand Challenge opportunities   Quantum approaches motivated by Grand Challenges show promise for   providing new capabilities and tools for sensing and metrology,   communication, simulation, and computation. This is vital for   fundamental research and promotes security, health, and the economy.   For example, quantum sensing holds the promise to provide advanced   sensors for military mission impact, to develop new measurement   science and quantum-based standards, to improve navigation and   timing technologies, and to environmental sensing in novel settings.   Single-photon detectors may become possible at far infrared and   microwave wavelengths to expand the range of discovery of the dark   universe, while non-classical emitters could be integrated for sensing,   communication, and computing systems at room temperature.   Today’s noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) technology will offer   insight into the scientific and technological advances that can address   QIS Grand Challenges in areas such as machine learning, simulation of   many-body systems for materials discovery, chemical processes,   quantum field theory, and dynamics of biological processes. Early   exploratory efforts in NISQ systems are already yielding new   understanding of these problems. This can help overcome scientific and   technological barriers for developing resilient and reliable devices,   including networking and storage devices, as well as algorithms and   error correction techniques."

37,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"5 Creating a quantum-smart workforce for tomorrow  Growing an American quantum-smart workforce with expertise in a broad range of physical, information, and engineering sciences is crucial for assuring sustained progress in QIS. However, America’s current educational system typically focuses on discrete disciplinary tracks, rarely emphasizing cross-disciplinary study that equips graduates for complex modern questions and challenges, prominently including QIS. While the responsibility of training students traditionally resides within the academic community, Government agencies and industry can partner with academia to meet the nation’s future needs.  Fundamental research is the main mechanism for generating a qualified workforce in QIS. Within the context of the need for individuals with a broad mix of skills, support for the trans-sector and transdisciplinary approach to research is essential. Students trained in such an environment will be exposed to a diverse yet convergent set of disciplines, along with the associated tools and infrastructure. This will allow students to obtain qualifications and skills required by U.S. industry, national laboratories, and academia. Existing approaches of this nature include special research tracks in academic programs, early career awards from Government agencies, support for focused research groups, and coordinated training with industry. Using and enhancing these programs can increase the size of the QIS workforce. Furthermore, approaches that synthesize these programs, such as industrial collaborations that engaging with a central, fundamental research program, can prepare students with additional skills crucial to entering the workforce in the private sector to further U.S. leadership in quantum science and technology.  Agencies will be encouraged to expand or develop specific programs that foster workforce development and build off each other’s strengths and mission. A number of agencies already have existing programs, such as the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship Program and the Accelerating Discovery Program; the National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship Program and the Quantum Science and Engineering Program at the Department of Defense (DOD); Science Undergraduate Laboratory internships, the Graduate Student Research Program, and the Computational Science Graduate Fellowship Program at the Department of Energy (DOE); and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) joint research centers that combine Government researchers with university students, postdoctoral scholars, and faculty. These programs can be enriched, modified, and expanded when driven by agency need. Further improvements may include joining existing efforts of different agencies to increase impact, such as by creating joint early-career programs.  Looking to the longer-term horizon, academic faculty provide the bedrock of training programs. Universities should be encouraged to address the workforce development needs by adding tenured or tenure-track faculty within the interdisciplinary themes associated with QIS and consider Quantum Science and Engineering as a discipline for future concentration, exemplified in steps such as creating new departments or thesis tracks. Other avenues include new undergraduate programs, engagement with industry and Government for internships and externships—predominantly for U.S. persons—and new professional development programs, including encouragement for creation of specialized technical programs. These students become ambassadors of their discipline while following a wide range of different paths in their careers, increasing the societal impact of quantum-science education.  Beyond the university, outreach to a broader audience will be essential. A strong comprehensive program in K-12 computational and scientific thinking featuring computer science and physics must start with developing interest at an early stage. A critical role can be played by industry, professional societies, and agencies with vested interest in appropriate outreach, which can help provide access to novel technologies (for example via cloud-based approaches) as well as developing classroom-based learning opportunities and broader connections to the public over various media platforms. At the same time, informal education tools, such as those found in many museums across the Nation, are effective and complementary to the classroom. These overall efforts work best in coordination with the NSTC Committee on STEM and its subcommittees that address STEM and related education.  Improving academic-industrial pathways   One program that is expanding connections across sectors is the recently   developed NSF-funded Quantum Information Science and Engineering   Network, https://qisenet.uchicago.edu/, also known as “TRIPLETS.” This   effort promotes small research projects executed by American graduate   students over a course of 3 years in close collaboration with an academic   principal investigator and an industrial partner, including extended stays   at an industrial laboratory or utilizing infrastructure. This enables a direct   and smooth transition to an industrial environment upon the TRIPLETS   project completion."
38,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"Workforce generation efforts and future U.S. workforce needs of the nascent quantum industry should be periodically assessed, through industrial engagement (described in the following section) and work with established STEM efforts. This information can help guide future programs to produce the diverse workforce needed to support the quantum ecosystem. In order to improve the workforce development program over time, an assessment plan of quantum workforce development activities should be encouraged to allow participants to select and expand the most successful strategies and adapt, change, or terminate what does not work. Collaboration with professional societies and organizations, industrial consortia, and local governments are other means of assessing workforce needs."
39,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"6 Deepening engagement with quantum industry  The revolutionary advances expected to come from QIS have already led to substantial industry attention on QIS research and development. Both large companies and a variety of startups and small businesses are investing heavily in quantum sensing, networking, computing, and supporting technologies. Several have already realized or will soon unveil next-generation quantum sensors, entanglement distribution over small networks, and quantum processors in the 50-qubit range, with plans to continue on a rapid-growth trajectory. In view of the economic and national security importance of QIS the Government will develop means to coordinate with U.S. industry.  A critical element in a robust quantum ecosystem is a strong base of quantum-essential supporting technologies that are not intrinsically quantum in themselves. Current examples include cryogenics, photonics, low-noise microwave amplifiers, and nanofabrication. Thus the consortium should work to identify and stay abreast of these evolving needs, as well as work in partnership with Government agencies and industry to nurture and grow these technologies in cases where they are weak or do not yet exist. Existing approaches such as SBIR and STTR programs that promote innovation for small businesses can be integrated with or combined with other approaches such as joint research centers.  In addition, as a key mechanism for industry engagement, the Government should foster the formation of a U.S. Quantum Consortium with participants from industry, academia, and Government. Like prior consortia such as the Semiconductor Research Corporation, a consortium provides a forum for technical exchanges and discussions to establish a mutual understanding of QIS industry’s trajectory, opportunities, and critical technical gaps and projected needs (e.g., for workforce, infrastructure, standards, and road-mapping). Furthermore, the consortium can also provide a venue for joint publicprivate funding to address infrastructure and technology gaps, and key pre-competitive research and development. Additional input can be provided by advisory bodies as appropriate, such as the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as well as coordination with other NSTC subcommittees.  Finally, joint research centers— partnerships between industry, academia, and Government—can"
40,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"accelerate pre-competitive QIS research and development, and in the process help address both the looming need for a greatly expanded and diverse quantum workforce and scientific and applied Grand Challenges. These centers can also facilitate and improve technology transfer from Government research labs. More generally, mechanisms such as incubators for translation from the lab to small companies should be expanded, and roadblocks removed where possible. For a meaningful collaboration environment to exist, intellectual property concerns will also need to be addressed and methods for realizing the development technology emphasized where possible.  Providing critical infrastructure  The successful development of technologies based on QIS will enable increasingly more advanced quantum research, but hinges on the availability of suitable tools, facilities, and other infrastructure items. The QIS research and development enterprise is not yet large enough to sustain an industry focused on developing and supplying all the necessary infrastructure. A targeted expansion of the relevant Federal and industrial infrastructure and support activities is needed to accelerate progress and prepare Federal agencies and industry to adopt the ensuing quantum technologies.   The U.S. Government can play a critical role in fostering this field by encouraging programs that target the development and fielding of supporting technologies, ranging from component technologies all the way to sophisticated fabrication and characterization technologies. Agencies will be encouraged to explore mechanisms to provide the QIS research community with increased access to existing and future Federal facilities, including manufacturing facilities that can be repurposed and expanded as well as systems and testbeds for post-quantum applications. As some of these infrastructure capabilities include large user facilities, the Government will consider enhancements to existing Federal facilities and whether Federally-funded QIS research centers should play a role in providing infrastructure or testbeds. Together, these actions will accelerate progress in QIS research and help solidify  U.S.  leadership in this field."
41,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"Current needs include: classical hardware components, materials characterization and fabrication facilities, critical minerals and materials, and a variety of end-user tools, platforms, and testbeds. The Government will engage with experts and stakeholders, as well as industry and academia, to identify critical infrastructure and map the current infrastructure landscape. For example, the"
42,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"U.S.  Quantum Consortium can help determine which of the component technologies will have a sufficient economic base to encourage industrial development, can help develop industry engagement with post-quantum applications, and can also periodically track progress and tap external expertise to evaluate the effectiveness of investments being made. In accordance with evolving needs, these efforts should be on-going."
43,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"Enabling the next generation of quantum science   Quantum states are extraordinarily fragile, and successfully using them   for applications will require an unprecedented level of control and   sophistication. For this reason, QIS will require new classes of high  performance classical components and instrumentation capable of   realizing these exacting requirements. These components will cover a   broad range of technologies and systems, from ultra-cold cooling   systems, to precision electronic and optical systems, and even rather   basic components like cables appropriate for carrying quantum signals.   The lack of suitable and reliable classical components and equipment is   one of the biggest hurdles to surmount in attempting to realize useful QIS   devices.   In addition, progress in certain areas of QIS is already limited by the   unavailability of specialized materials and advanced technologies for   materials characterization. For example, unknown dynamics on the   metal surfaces of ion traps limit the performance of ion-based qubits.   Recently, U.S. researchers made use of a Rapid Access Proposal to Oak   Ridge’s Center for Nanophase Materials Science to access a series of   sophisticated tools for surface characterization to better understand   these defects.   Quantum devices also require sophisticated fabrication capabilities. For   instance, over the past decade, access to the Microsystems and   Engineering Sciences Application (MESA) fabrication facility has allowed   Sandia National Laboratories to develop and mature ion trap devices to   a level where they now serve as the base component across numerous   academic and industry labs, and enable exploration of quantum   computing, quantum sensing, and other related technologies."
44,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"In addition to bolstering infrastructure, it is important to nurture the adoption of quantum technologies within the Federal Government by cultivating potential end-user agencies. A culture of information sharing has sprung up organically among the personnel at the Federal agencies funding QIS and those looking to leverage future applications. The Government will encourage this culture, and the interagency process will provide a sounding board for promulgating such shared interest and promoting the leveraging of Federal investments in advancing each agency’s mission. Furthermore, it will explore methods to spur engagement from those end-user agencies that have not yet played a role in developing the technology, but could benefit from the output of this research. Indeed, the impact of QIS will be felt broadly, and it will be important for each agency to be aware of how the quantum revolution may augment its mission space. The establishment of end-user testbed facilities along with training and engagement will allow Federal agencies and stakeholders to explore relevant applications."
45,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"8 Maintaining national security and economic growth  National security needs often drive the advancement of new science and technology and enable economic development through enhanced Government investments, dedicated initiatives, and crossagency collaborations. At the same time, creating new markets and industries enhance our ability to address national security needs, but the scientific and economic advances can lead to new risks. An appropriate balance between growth and risk can provide long-term benefits.  The technologies that are anticipated to result from intensified research and development in QIS may provide solutions to some of the nation’s most pressing national security concerns. For example, advancements in quantum computing may allow for improvements in effective drug discovery, modeling of chemical reactions to enhance corrosion-resistant materials, and optimizing logistics solutions. These and other opportunities in networking and sensing can play a positive role in ensuring national security and defense.  However, there may be challenges to public safety and security that arise from these same technologies. For example, one key quantum algorithm will be able to break public-key cryptography, which secures transactions over the internet. While employing this algorithm is far beyond the current level of technology, the need to protect sensitive data and provide a reliable infrastructure over the long-term requires moving to “post-quantum” or “quantum-resistant” forms of cryptography.   QIS technologies being developed for military and defense applications can also accelerate advancements in the field, leading to substantial economic growth potential through the creation of new industries and products and their transition to consumer markets. The defense and intelligence communities have been strong investors in QIS research and development over the last twenty years, and continue to work across the basic science and applied technology areas to improve the understanding of what is possible with QIS and support the necessary technological base. Enhanced industrial engagement and infrastructure improvements described in the previous sections will also enhance national security and provide economic growth by fostering QIS within the United States rather than leaving innovators to seek support elsewhere.  As the technology evolves, its potential impact on military applications will mean that continual monitoring of export and trade regulations, including the Wassenaar Arrangement control lists and their domestic implementation in the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and International Traffic in Arms Regulation (ITAR), will be necessary. Furthermore, the defense community has special needs for diverse workforce development; pathways should be added from programs that build a quantum-smart workforce into defenserelated research and development. Finally, it is imperative that while developing the QIS enterprise in the United States, the Government also protects intellectual property and economic interests, seeks to understand dual-use capabilities, and supports national-security-relevant applications that emerge from QIS research at every level from basic research to commercialization of QIS technologies.  Improving defense through quantum technologies   Advanced computing capabilities have long been used to enhance both   military capability and economic productivity. As such, general purpose   quantum algorithms for optimization, machine learning, materials   development, and chemical calculations should continue to be explored;   although their quantum speed-up is still unknown, any improvements in   direct computational ability or in resulting materials and systems could   greatly impact military effectiveness.   Beyond computation, new or quantum-enhanced systems could enable   the next-generation of sensors and detectors for defense applications. As   an example, precision relies on the deep understanding of the quantum   properties of atoms; further development can impact both next  generation Global Positioning Systems (GPS) and scenarios where GPS is   unavailable. There are further synergies in defense requirements for low   size, weight, and power devices via new modalities of sensing.    Exploration of quantum networking also has potential defense value,   and could offer added functionality to quantum computation and   quantum sensing. Robust solutions to distributing entanglement over   multiple length scales—from across a chip to across the world—could   enable distributed quantum computers and distributed sensors, with the   potential for long-term impact in secure communication. Understanding   how quantum effects impact communication, from bandwidth and   latency, to security, to novel networking technologies and algorithms,   will help realize the best networking systems."
46,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"Thus the SCQIS will, in conjunction with other NSTC subcommittees, Federal agencies, and the defense and intelligence communities, ensure consistent application of existing classification and export control mechanisms to provide the largest amount of information possible to American universities and industry about actions related to QIS research."
47,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"9 Advancing international cooperation  Science, technology, and innovation are cornerstones of U.S. prosperity and economic development and also dominant forces internationally, particularly given the highly interconnected world of the 21st century, where businesses operate globally and scientists and engineers collaborate across borders. Considering the global nature of scientific and industrial enterprises, the United States, including the private sector, has cooperated with foreign partners in QIS research for more than twenty years. These partnerships have accelerated scientific discovery and technological applications while promoting U.S. economic growth and national security.  In order to maintain U.S. leadership and competitiveness in QIS, the United States must work with international partners, even while advancing domestic investments and research strategies. As discoveries accelerate in all sectors, the United States should seek to increase international cooperation with like-minded governments and industrial partners to ensure that technologies resulting from today’s investments in basic research and technological development continue to benefit Americans. Sustained domestic investments and strategic international collaboration and cooperation will be vital to this goal.  The Government will focus on three strategic international efforts for QIS. The first effort will be regular reviews of international collaboration activities and partnerships, to identify and track worldwide QIS science and technology trends and identify gaps and opportunities, understand the evolving international QIS landscape, and inform existing programs. Second, the Government will identify and prioritize strategic bilateral partnerships to ensure that the United States continues to attract and retain the best international and has access to international technologies, research facilities, and experts in QIS. Third, the Government should encourage merit-based and transparent fundamental research and innovation systems, and open access to public data arising from QIS research, as appropriate, as well as to advance the development of international standards that enable adoption of new QIS-inspired technologies."
48,4,USA,2018,NATIONAL STRATEGIC  OVERVIEW FOR QUANTUM  INFORMATION SCIENCE,"Appendix: Current U.S. leadership in QIS research areas  The United States sustains a vibrant community in QIS. World-leading research groups in the Nation’s universities, companies, and national labs have driven progress in many of the critical areas of quantum computing and quantum systems for time-keeping, sensing, networking, and other applications. This status as a leader in quantum research and development is a direct result of the U.S. Government funding agencies and institutions sustained investment in basic and applied research. Both broad and focused programs, built atop a foundation of well-staffed and well-equipped research institutions, have created a talented workforce, encouraged broad innovation and exploration, and dedicated the necessary hard work in physics, materials science, and associated areas necessary to make progress in the development of working, controllable quantum systems. Throughout this effort, the United States has benefited from a many-headed funding model where, for example, one Agency continues to fund critical topics as another changes focus. Furthermore, combining funding driven by mission needs to ensure long-term development with science-driven funding to create the new ideas that seed further innovation provides additional resiliency.  Progress in QIS has recently begun a significant expansion from increases in private sector research and development. Over the last five years, particularly in quantum computing, large IT companies and the venture capital and start-up community have engaged with new QIS opportunities and formed groups and companies to pursue commercialization. It should be noted that all this is possible because of the wealth and know-how that these companies and communities gained from the previous computing and internet revolutions they helped create. The national strategic approach should continue to leverage these strengths of both the U.S. Government funding system and the U.S. innovation ecosystem.  Finally, significant contributions to QIS research have been made in other countries. The field has advanced in the United States in some part by recruiting, collaborating, and competing with science around the world. As a case in point, the first two-qubit gate proposal came from researchers in Europe, but was demonstrated in the Nobel-prize winning group of David Wineland at NIST. This reflects the increasingly global character of the science and technology enterprise. In a field where scientists are still very much fighting nature itself to make progress, humanity’s combined effort may be necessary to tackle the challenge. U.S. leadership at this juncture will provide the key ingredients for this success.  QIS comprises fundamental science and technology across many platforms and topics, and touches upon many agencies. This includes the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Defense (DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of the Interior (DOI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State (State), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Science Foundation (NSF), National Security Agency (NSA), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).   The SCQIS assesses the national portfolio using seven broad categories: four in fundamental science (S1-S4) and three in technological development (T1-T3).   S1. Quantum sensing: leveraging quantum mechanics to enhance the fundamental accuracy of measurements and/or enabling new regimes or modalities for sensors and measurement science [DOD, DOE, DHS, DOI, NIST, NSF, ODNI] S2. Quantum computing: from devices and algorithms for analog simulation of quantum systems in the laboratory to controlled digital quantum computers [DOD, DOE, NASA, NIST, NSF, NSA, ODNI]  S3. Quantum networking: exploring and using coherent or entangled multi-party quantum states, distributed at distances, for new information technology applications and fundamental science [DOD, NASA, NIST, NSF]  S4. Scientific advances enabled by quantum devices and theory advances: improved understanding of materials, chemistry, cosmology, classical computation techniques, and other aspects of fundamental science [DOE, NIST, NSF]  T1. Supporting technology: necessary analog, digital, electrical, mechanical, optical, computational, and cryogenic systems and techniques that underpin the fundamental science areas [DOD, NASA, NIST, NSF, NSA, ODNI]  T2. Future applications: opportunities for improvements in operations research, optimization, machine learning, drug discovery, etc. [all SCQIS agencies engaged]  T3. Risk mitigation: necessary infrastructure and support for quantum technologies and their impact, such as quantum-resistant cryptosystems and other post-quantum applications [DHS, NIST, NSA]  The Nation’s efforts in these areas include a number of agencies that have over the years driven research and development in these seven categories. Current Federal agencies conducting or funding these topic areas are identified above. These seven areas represent the broad foundation necessary to support a full industrial and Governmental effort in quantum information science and technology. The SCQIS also has examined current funding, and finds at the present time that it is primarily focused on S1-S4, as shown in the graph below."
