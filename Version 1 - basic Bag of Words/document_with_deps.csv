Message from
the minister
Australia’s leadership in quantum
technologies today is the result of
sustained investment over decades.
It’s a success story that speaks
to patient public investment in
basic research, the lure of our
world‑leading educational institutions
and uniquely Australian skills and know‑how.
Now, with use of quantum technologies poised
to grow globally by 33% over the next 5 years, and
countries ramping up investment in domestic quantum
capabilities, we cannot afford to lose our globally recognised edge.
Thirty years ago, Australian universities were some of the few in the world to offer postgraduate qualifications
in quantum physics. Today, graduates of those programs are leading projects around the world, in industry and
academia, from IBM to Alphabet, from the University of Bristol to Stanford University in the United States. Australian
talent is here and overseas, and has been behind a range of breakthroughs in quantum applications, including
quantum random number generators for cyber security and sensors for mining.
Quantum technologies are here, now. Throughout this strategy are examples of Australian‑made innovations
that have already moved from new ideas in university labs to commercial products used by industries. Quantum
sensors are being deployed to detect ore deposits buried deep underground. Quantum random number generators
are making global banking more efficient and more secure. Quantum control infrastructure software is being
put to work on public transport optimisation challenges. And quantum computing – which is poised to transform
industries and unlock previously intractable challenges – is edging closer to reality.
Quantum technologies will make a difference improving economic and national wellbeing. They have the potential
to inform new drug discoveries, support emissions reduction, help us transition to a net zero economy and safeguard
resilient cyber infrastructure. It’s no longer ‘if’, but ‘when’. Commercialising quantum technologies could create
an Australian quantum industry worth $2.2 billion and directly employing 8,700 people by 2030. This could reach
approximately $6 billion and 19,400 jobs by 2045. These technologies are expected to add billions of dollars of
value to related industries in that timeframe.
Australians are innovators. We have some excellent success stories, but we don’t back our successes nearly
enough. We have many notable examples of great innovations ‑ including building one of the world’s first ever
digital computers – but we’ve often fallen short translating early leadership into sustained commercial outcomes.
We have all of the ingredients to sustain our existing leadership on quantum into the next decade. This National
Quantum Strategy – the first quantum strategy for Australia – brings them together and sets the course for a
growing, vibrant quantum industry and research ecosystem.
The National Quantum Strategy recognises the importance of commercialisation opportunities, robust infrastructure,
a skilled workforce, clear standards and (most importantly) community trust to the long‑term success of quantum
in Australia. It has been drafted against a backdrop of accelerating geopolitical interest in quantum technologies,
with the US, China, the UK and the European Union all scaling up investment in the last 2 years.
This National Quantum Strategy has been eagerly awaited – not just by our local ecosystem, but by international
partners. It will be a useful guide for investments in quantum technologies by private and public investors
alike. It will support the Australian Government in developing closer ties with trusted partners to collaborate
on investments in quantum infrastructure and quantum solutions to global problems.
The Australian Government is revitalising manufacturing and investing in the skills, capabilities and strengths
that sustain a resilient, innovative economy. Quantum technologies are critical to Australia’s national interests.
We should all be proud of the outsized impact Australian quantum research and innovation has had on the
global stage. And we must continue to grow our capabilities here.
The Hon Ed Husic MP
Minister for Industry and Science

Message from
Australia’s Chief
Scientist
Australia has had its finger on the quantum pulse
since Professors RQ Twiss and AG Little published
the first paper on time‑correlated photons in 1959.
Since then, and especially in the past 25 years, we’ve
made significant research investment, resulting in
an emerging Australian quantum industry that is
destined to have a significant impact on all of our lives.
The impact of the quantum revolution will be comparable to the digital revolution that brought us transistors
and lasers, which are the basis of all our modern electronics, computers and communications.
Quantum sensors are already enabling the detection of things that were previously hidden to us down to the tiniest
scales, bringing new sensitivity in medical imaging and in detection of underground mineral deposits. Australia’s
quantum industry will improve cyber security with advances in quantum encryption and communications. Quantum
computers will enable calculation, modelling and data management in ways impossible for classical computers.
Australia is well positioned to capitalise on the amazing research that is making its way out of the lab.
Our entrepreneurial spirit is generating new start‑ups and attracting major companies. This is our chance to
grow a thriving deep‑tech industry, built out of coordinated, long‑term government investment and a critical mass
of world‑class Australian‑trained quantum specialists. We are in the top handful of countries embarking on a quantum
ambition. But we have to act now, as there is intense global attention on the promise of quantum.
In 2020, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) worked with Australian quantum
researchers to prepare a roadmap that articulated the opportunity. The National Quantum Strategy is the next step,
with the aim of ensuring we realise the opportunity.
This strategy will evolve and be updated as needed to reflect the rapid changes occurring across the Australian
quantum industry, with the creation of new companies, new global investments and a maturing regional opportunity.
What is clear is that success requires a concerted system‑wide focus, to ensure skills development and workforce
inclusivity, access to infrastructure and the right regulation. This is a shared mission whose goal is to improve our lives,
solve global environmental, medical and energy challenges, and understand more about our place in the cosmos as
we chart humanity’s future.
It was such an honour to lead the development of Australia’s National Quantum Strategy. With the support of a
dedicated taskforce in the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, we have engaged with industry leaders,
academics, investors and government officials. We visited many companies, start‑ups and labs across Australia and
overseas, including in the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea. There have been
9 roundtables, 6 town hall meetings and 2 public consultation papers. A National Quantum Advisory Committee
was established and has provided excellent insights, feedback and advice. Engagement from the quantum community
has been phenomenal and I thank all contributors.
This process has strengthened my confidence that, with clear‑eyed determination, investment and a collaborative
approach across government, research and industry, the transformative capabilities of quantum technologies are
ours to realise.
Dr Cathy Foley AO PSM

Executive summary
Australia is on the cusp of a transformation driven by advances in technology. With the right policy, regulatory
and economic framework, this transformation will:
• modernise our economy
• improve our society
• support national interests
• create high‑paying jobs for future generations.
Quantum technologies are at the centre of this transformation, enabling potential new manufacturing techniques,
drug treatments and advances in foundational science.
Vision
In 2030, Australia is recognised as a leader of the global quantum
industry, and quantum technologies are integral to a prosperous,
fair and inclusive Australia.
A strategy built on consultation
The National Quantum Strategy is based on extensive consultation with the quantum sector and wider community
over 2022. Consultation was led by Australia’s Chief Scientist, Dr Cathy Foley AO PSM, and included submissions,
roundtables, working groups and town hall meetings. The level and quality of participation highlighted the sector’s
potential and appetite for action.
These consultations helped us identify the key efforts and actions needed to realise Australia’s quantum opportunity.
We also drew on the guidance of our National Quantum Advisory Committee and contributions from state and
territory governments.
Opportunities and challenges
The quantum industry has highlighted the opportunities and challenges that Australia faces to maximise
the benefits of quantum technology.
We have opportunities to:
• capitalise on our expertise
• build sovereign capability for future advancements
• benefit from economic growth and improvements in productivity
• position Australia as an international destination for talent and investment with a strong local ecosystem.
But we also face challenges in:
• commercialising products
• attracting long‑term capital
• accessing infrastructure
• ensuring fit‑for‑purpose frameworks that support Australia’s national interest
• meeting the sector’s growing quantum skills needs.
As well as economic opportunities, adopting quantum technologies may impact Australians’ safety, security
and values. The strategy’s actions will capitalise on these opportunities and address the identified challenges.

Our themes
The National Quantum Strategy has 5 central themes. Each theme has a set of actions over 7 years
that will position Australia for success. The themes are focused on:
1. creating thriving research and development, investment in and use of quantum technologies
2. securing access to essential quantum infrastructure and materials
3. building a skilled and growing quantum workforce
4. ensuring our standards and frameworks support national interests
5. building a trusted, ethical and inclusive quantum ecosystem
The strategy outlines how the Australian Government will deliver on its vision. It also signals areas
the government may consider in the future, including investment opportunities.
Australia’s quantum ambition will not be realised by working alone – every part of the quantum ecosystem
needs to work towards the same goal, including through investments. The government will drive the
implementation of the strategy, but other partners will lead some actions and initiatives. We will draw
on the strengths of industry, businesses, universities, states, territories and international partners to ensure
Australia realises its quantum opportunity.

Quantum technologies
Quantum science describes the behaviour of matter and light on the atomic and subatomic scale.
Quantum behaviours – particularly quantisation, superposition and entanglement – can be used to build
advanced technologies that would otherwise seem impossible.
Quantum technologies are developing rapidly with researchers regularly identifying new applications. While some
quantum technologies like computing are still emerging, others are already in everyday use. Australia has already
led breakthroughs in areas such as:
• quantum theory
• quantum optics
• semiconductor and superconducting devices
• atomic physics
• precision timing and sensing
• cybersecurity.
The National Quantum Strategy addresses the full spectrum of quantum technologies. It provides a pathway
for growing applications that are close to being commercialised, such as quantum sensors. It will also set Australia
up for success in longer‑term applications such as quantum computing.
Different technologies will mature and be ready for commercial applications at different times over the next 10 years,
and beyond. Some technologies will not have a simple or quick path from research to commercialisation.
The strategy also recognises the importance of building foundational capabilities for quantum technologies, including
software engineering, applications and algorithms. See the appendix for a description of quantum technologies.

Australia’s quantum opportunity
Australia’s quantum opportunity is immense. Australia is recognised as a global quantum leader, with some
of the best minds in quantum research and applied technology. The government is taking action to grow the tech
sector – including quantum technologies – to improve our economy’s long‑term performance and the prosperity
of all Australians.
The technology sector is already Australia’s third‑largest industry, employing 1 in 16 workers and contributing
$167 billion to our economy every year, or 8.5% of GDP. The sector is growing rapidly and is forecast to contribute
$244 billion a year by 2031.
Quantum capabilities will amplify the growth of this sector and lead to entirely new kinds of technologies
in the longer term. Australian quantum companies already attract significant venture capital investment compared
to our international competitors, capturing a 3.6% share of global venture capital for quantum from 2017 to 2021.
Case study: Quantum supporting
other economic sectors
Quantum science can be applied to improve our understanding
of industrial processes.
An Australian start‑up, Jovian Tech, is building process
instrumentation to measure the spin‑isomer ratio in hydrogen
molecules. The thermophysical properties of molecular
hydrogen depend critically on the spin state of the molecule.
Chemical engineers can use information from Jovian
Tech to optimise hydrogen production plant operations
and lower costs in the hydrogen economy.
The importance of quantum technologies extends beyond economics, jobs, and applications for business and industry.
In time, quantum technologies will be an important national capability supporting our security and our way of life.
Ensuring Australia has a sovereign quantum capability will let us keep pace with the latest advances and shape the
evolving technology landscape in our national interest.
Realising the potential of quantum technologies will have risks and challenges. The main challenges facing Australia’s
quantum sector have been identified and are addressed through this strategy (see ‘Quantum opportunities and
challenges’, below).
Other challenges that need to be carefully managed include:
• economic headwinds
• a tightening global investment climate
• uncertainty over development timelines and which technologies will be successful.
International competition will also create uncertainty and opportunities. Countries across the globe are
investing billions into quantum technologies, and the Australian industry needs support to keep its leading
position. Australia has already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in establishing deep technical skills.
It is now time to build on and increase these efforts while building in resilience to global changes.
12
Case study: Addressing transportation challenges
In 2020 Transport for NSW approached Q‑CTRL with an interest in understanding how they – as an
organisation with heavy computational challenges – could put quantum computing to work for them.
Many problems in managing transport services are computationally challenging – from timetabling of
intersecting modes of transport to meet known patterns of demand through to dynamically routing vehicles
to meet changing traffic patterns. These problems quickly grow intractable, even for advanced computing
tools, as the number of ‘interacting’ modes of transport, vehicles, connection points and stops grows.
Q‑CTRL took on the challenge and has focused on getting Transport for NSW quantum ready via a
combination of quantum professional services and quantum control infrastructure software development.
Q‑CTRL worked with Transport for NSW to improve the performance of quantum algorithms relevant to
transport optimisation problems and charted a path to quantum advantage.
Q‑CTRL identified a new hardware‑efficient algorithmic implementation which enables modelling of transport
networks on near‑term quantum computers using fewer computational resources than otherwise expected.
The team built a custom circuit simulator to simulate multiqubit algorithms subject to the real noise endemic
to near‑term quantum computer hardware, and tested their prototype solutions on real cloud‑accessible
machines. The results demonstrated that the target mobility‑as‑a‑service problem could really be efficiently
solved by a quantum computer, even in the presence of imperfections.
Having demonstrated a real quantum advantage in large‑scale network optimisation looks to be possible,
Q‑CTRL is currently building a custom software package for Transport for NSW. This will deliver the ability
to optimize the execution of quantum algorithms for mobility‑as‑a‑service problems to end users with
expertise in transport analytics and data science.

Quantum technologies boosting the economy
The global quantum computing market is estimated to grow at a compound rate of more than 30% a year over
the next 5 years 31.9% over the next 5 years.
In Australia, conservative estimates forecast revenue from quantum computing, communications and sensing could
be worth $5.9 billion by 2045. Quantum technology development could contribute $6.1 billion to GDP by the same
year. This includes $2.4 billion in indirect benefits due to productivity gains.
The quantum technology industry could directly employ 19,400 people. Adopting quantum technology could create
more than 35,000 jobs across the economy by 2045.

1 High, central and low projections reflect different published estimates of how quickly quantum technologies may develop and be adopted by
industries. The central projection aligns with CSIRO’s 2045 forecasts.
A growing quantum sector will have significant direct benefits for the Australian economy. But quantum technologies
will have an even greater economic impact on other sectors, providing an advantage to Australian industries. Quantum
sensors are already transforming industries, including mining, where quantum sensors are used detect minerals.
Quantum could have a greater impact on technology than the transition from vacuum tubes to semiconductors
had on conventional computing.
Case study: Using quantum
sensors to find minerals
LANDTEM is an Australian technology developed
by CSIRO that uses quantum sensors to detect
magnetic fields that are 100 millionth of the size
of earth’s magnetic fields. This makes LANDTEM
ideal for finding deep bodies of highly conducting
ores, including nickel sulphide, copper and silver.
It differentiates the target ore from other material,
even when buried deep underground.
LANDTEM improves mineral exploration outcomes.
It has helped discover more than $10 billion of ore
deposits around the world with $4 billion of these
discoveries located in Australia.
LANDTEM has been used by Glencore, Legend
Mining, Mincor Resources, Western Areas, Aeris
Resources and companies in Canada. Legend
Mining, for example, has most recently announced
detection of new prospective nickel copper deposits
in September 2022.
Clients have seen LANDTEM reduce their
operational costs of exploration by up to 30%.
Case study: Improved efficiency in global banking
A major global bank, with an extensive virtual machine deployment hosting a range of
banking services, was experiencing delays and the potential for duplicate keys used
by the cryptographic processes for securing data and communication. Working with
Quintessence Labs, a quantum random number generation (QRNG) solution was explored
to ensure the timely delivery of high‑quality randomness consumed by the cryptographic
processes running in the virtual machines.
The QRNG network appliances were deployed in all of the bank’s data centres around
the world, delivering entropy as a service. Previously, during busy periods, login and
cryptographically intensive operations had response delays of several tens of seconds.
After the QRNG solution, response times improved by up to 100 times. QRNG lowered
the virtual machine instances of duplicate keys from 2.5% to none.
The solution gave the bank clear visibility of demand for randomness across the
whole organisation.

Case study: Leveraging existing partnerships
Australia and the US have signed a joint statement of cooperation on quantum technologies.
This will enhance both countries’ quantum industries by improving market access and knowledge sharing.
We are also exploring similar partnerships with other nations.
Quad
The Quad – Australia, India, Japan and the United States – works to uphold a stable, peaceful and prosperous
Indo‑Pacific region. The Quad’s positive, practical agenda benefits the region by using its combined strengths
and capabilities to respond to the region’s key challenges.
The Quad is harnessing critical and emerging technologies to enhance the prosperity and security of the
region. This work is organised into 4 areas:
• technology standards
• 5G deployment and diversification
• technology supply chains
• horizon scanning.
The Quad will continue to strengthen its horizon scanning cooperation with a future focus on quantum
technologies, and through convening the Quad Technology Business and Investment Forum for networking
with industry partners to expand capital for critical and emerging technologies.
AUKUS
The Australia, United Kingdom and United States enhanced trilateral partnership (AUKUS) has 2 related lines
of effort – nuclear‑powered submarines and advanced capabilities. The partnership is committed to developing
joint advanced military capabilities to promote security and stability in the Indo‑Pacific region.
The AUKUS Quantum Arrangement (AQuA) is a core component of this work. AQuA will work to accelerate
investments to deliver generation‑after‑next quantum military capabilities. There will be an initial focus on
quantum technologies for positioning, navigation and timing. It is intended that the AQuA work will integrate
emerging quantum technologies in trials and experimentation over the next 3 years.
While AUKUS’s primary focus is on enhancing defence capabilities, going forward there will potentially
be opportunities for Australia’s broader quantum ecosystem to contribute to and support Defence’s
research efforts occurring through AUKUS.
Case study: Collaborating for commercial quantum computers
The University of Technology Sydney’s Centre for Quantum Software and Information (QSI) is participating
in the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA) quantum benchmarking program.
The program quantitatively assesses the performance of quantum computing algorithms and applications
at scale. These multi‑million dollar projects will be creating new tools and techniques for these assessments
and involves global companies including HRL Laboratories, Boeing and General Motors, and quantum
technology companies including Zapata Computing, Rigetti Computing, and IonQ.
The quantum benchmarking program is estimating the long‑term utility of quantum computers by
creating benchmarks that quantitatively measure progress towards transformational computational
challenges. The program will also estimate the hardware resources needed to achieve different levels
of benchmark performance.
Quantum algorithms are currently benchmarked manually by a few experts, which typically takes several
months per application. This practice can be sped up significantly by using software to model error correction,
represent modern algorithmic techniques, and compile into low‑level instruction sets. QSI researchers are
developing the Bench‑Q software suite for this purpose with the University of Southern California, University
of Texas at Dallas, Aalto University in Finland, and Zapata Computing.
The quantum benchmarking program is using this software to estimate and optimise the cost of quantum
algorithms in the processor platforms of Rigetti Computing and IonQ.

Themes of the National
Quantum Strategy
The National Quantum Strategy has 5 themes to help realise the Australian Government’s ambition.
Each theme has a set of actions that will be completed over the next 7 years.
Together these actions address the opportunities and challenges facing Australia’s quantum industry.
They also provide the signals to attract investment from individuals, industry, academia and government.
The themes focus on the initial actions the government can take to create the conditions for a thriving quantum
industry. But to sustain the quantum industry long‑term, these actions require coordinated and collaborative efforts
with states, territories, businesses and researchers, as well as close engagement with the community.
Theme 1: Thriving research and development,
investment in and use of quantum technologies
The Australian Government will:
• invest in, connect and grow Australia’s quantum ecosystem so we continue
to compete with the world’s best
• incentivise the growth of quantum technologies helping to address
national challenges
• catalyse private and public investment in industry‑ready quantum technologies.
Immediate actions
Action 1.1
Design new programs to incentivise the continued growth of quantum use cases in sensing, communications,
and computing. The goal of these programs should be to fast‑track projects using quantum and other advanced
technologies to solve significant national challenges.
Action 1.2
Support initiatives to drive ecosystem growth, support commercialisation and enhance domestic and international
links with strategic partners. The government will seek out and support initiatives involving consortiums of
universities, quantum companies and industry translating quantum research into commercial outcomes.
Action 1.3
Grow a pipeline of quantum companies and technologies for potential future investment through the $15 billion
National Reconstruction Fund, with a minimum of $1 billion earmarked for investment in critical technologies.
22
What we’ve heard
Many of Australia’s quantum technology solutions are already commercially available or almost ready to be
commercialised. We have many ongoing opportunities to capitalise on, including expertise and ideas built from
years of investment in the research sector. This is backed by a government focused on long‑term benefits.
Our entrepreneurs and researchers are investing their time and talent into the next wave of quantum technologies
and applications. As quantum research and technologies mature, the commercial and industrial opportunities are
becoming more prominent. There are already tangible, scalable applications across a range of industries, with
more emerging. For example:
• Quantum sensors are being used to detect underground water leaks without digging, which could be used
to lower costs and proactively monitor for leaks.
• Quantum sensors are improving the speed and accuracy of measurements in civil engineering.
• Quantum computing can be used to optimise supply chains and public transport, reducing waste and emissions.
• Quantum computing is increasing the energy density of batteries, supporting the transition to renewable energy.
The sector faces challenges, including:
• attracting more early‑stage long‑term capital
• connecting ideas and solutions to businesses and investors.
But by demonstrating how quantum technologies can improve commercial outcomes and address key challenges,
quantum researchers and businesses can demonstrate their strengths and attract investment. This includes
demonstrating market‑ready products and solutions, as well as long‑term applications for key industries and
national capabilities. By building stronger connections between academia, business and industry, and translating
research into industrial and commercial applications, we will deliver on Australia’s quantum potential.
Australia’s small domestic market and smaller pool of venture and non‑dilutive capital means quantum companies
need to access overseas markets and investment. This is a challenge for the Australian quantum sector, whose
growth will depend on stronger international connections and lower barriers to doing business overseas.
The quantum sector could also access existing programs to accelerate research and grow. One of these programs
is the University Research Commercialisation Action Plan, a $2.2 billion investment to strengthen university innovation
and industry collaboration. It includes:
• Australia’s Economic Accelerator, a new $1.6 billion grant program to fund translation and commercialisation
in national priority areas
• the Trailblazer Universities Program, which will provide $362.5 million from 2021–2022 to 2025–2026. It will
help 6 selected universities boost prioritised research and development and drive commercialisation outcomes
with industry partners
• the National Industry PhD Program, which includes $296 million to establish a suite of industry PhD and research
fellowship schemes
• the Higher Education Research Commercialisation Intellectual Property Framework, which gives universities
standardised terms, clauses and agreements for collaborating on IP licensing, options and assignment.
This will increase collaboration by universities and help Australian industries use research outputs
• additional investment in the CSIRO ON program, which helps accelerate the impact of science research into
market and has supported more than 3000 people from 52 Australian research organisations to turn their science
into real‑world solutions
• additional investment in Main Sequence Ventures, which was created by CSIRO in 2017 and has already invested
in several Australian quantum start‑ups.
Other existing funding programs are:
• The Australian Research Council’s Centres of Excellence and National Competitive Grants Program (NCGP),
including its Discovery and Linkage programs and industry fellowships.
• Cooperative Research Centres, which provide long‑term and short‑term project funding for industry‑led
research collaborations.
23
Action impacts
These immediate actions address the challenges and opportunities identified in this strategy by:
• helping academia, industry and the community work together to solve challenges by using quantum capabilities
• growing Australia’s quantum ecosystem by improving coordination and collaboration between research
and industry. This will identify the uses that will increase quantum uptake and investment
• increasing investment by building on local expertise and sovereign capability to grow the economy,
increase productivity and create jobs.
National Reconstruction Fund
The Australian Government is establishing the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund (NRF) to support,
diversify and transform Australia’s industry. This will secure our future prosperity and drive sustainable
economic growth.
The NRF will target projects and investments that help Australia capture new, high‑value market opportunities.
This will help our businesses grow and succeed in the economy of tomorrow. The NRF will provide finance
(including loans, guarantees and equity) to drive investments that add value and develop capability in 7 priority
areas. The NRF will partner with industry to unlock private sector investment to create sustainable industries
and secure, well‑paid jobs.
The NRF will be an independent financier that operates commercially to deliver a positive rate of return. It will
be governed by a board who will make independent investment decisions guided by an investment mandate.
One of the NRF’s priority areas is enabling capabilities. It includes $1 billion of finance to grow advanced
manufacturing and support businesses to innovate and move up the technological ladder.
A further $1 billion will be used to grow critical technologies. This will support home‑grown innovation
and build industry capability in areas like artificial intelligence, quantum computing, robotics and software
development. The NRF will commence operation in 2023.
Case study: Quantum
supporting medical testing
Quantum scientists at the University of Melbourne, in collaboration
with the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and Mental Health, are
developing FeBI (ferritin bound iron) diagnostic technology using a
patented quantum sensing technology to detect iron loading within
serum ferritin.
This new technology contrasts with current tests which are
confounded by inflammation due to their reliance on the
ferritin protein levels rather than iron. A working prototype
has been demonstrated to be functional on laboratory ferritin
samples and the team is currently applying for funding and
investment for clinical validation and commercial development.
24
Case study: Exploring quantum possibilities with edge devices
Autonomous vehicles, robotics, and smartphones are just 3 examples of edge computing devices that
have become mainstream technologies. However, edge technology does not yet have the computational
ability necessary to handle complex algorithms, limiting the application of mainstream edge computing
devices for heavy‑duty computing.
Quantum computing could change that. As part of the Quantum Pioneers Program, the Pawsey
Supercomputing Research Centre partnered with Quantum Brilliance to enable industry and research
teams to explore the possibilities of edge quantum computing. One example of this is accelerating
speech transcription at the edge.
Quantum Brilliance worked with an industry partner Trellis to develop the Quantum Decoder – a hybrid
quantum – classical application that seeks to improve speech transcription algorithms. The Quantum
Decoder will replace the ‘beam search’ decoder algorithms that are deployed in many everyday applications
like vehicles and smartphones. Classical decoder algorithms truncate input data to provide results quickly,
but some input information is lost, reducing accuracy.
The Quantum Decoder promises to be both fast and accurate. It uses a quantum computer to decode
the input signal in a reasonable timeframe with no loss of information. This provides better accuracy
at the same computational speed as similar‑sized classical systems. The Quantum Decoder could be
generalised to any signal processing problem, not just speech transcription. This means it has the potential
to impact many industries, autonomous vehicles, robotics, smartphones, satellite image processing and
manufacturing optimisation.

Case study: Value chain for domestic supply and manufacturing
Silicon Quantum Computing (SQC) has worked with Australian industry to help build an end‑to‑end quantum
value chain.
To feed the manufacturing underway, SQC secures raw materials from a local provider Silex Systems.
With the support of the Department of Industry, Science and Resources’ CRC program, Silex expanded
its operations to include the production of isotopically pure silicon at its facilities in Lucas Heights, NSW.
Down‑stream of the hardware, SQC procures services from quantum software company Aqacia, which helps
develop machine learning tools focused on accelerating quantum computing chip development and insights.
While SQC is one of their local ‘anchors’, the digital nature of the company means that Aqacia is able to provide
services to, and earn revenue from, all over the world.
At the other end of the local value chain, SQC has had a long‑standing relationship with the Commonwealth
Bank and Telstra, its co‑development partners who recognised early the transformational nature of quantum
computing to their business. As the technology continues to mature, these essential partnerships have
informed the company of the valuable use cases and accelerated the development of the full quantum
computing stack in SQC to meet these requirements.

Theme 2: Securing access to essential
quantum infrastructure and materials
The Australian Government will:
• ensure that Australia’s quantum infrastructure supporting research and
development meets the needs of Australia’s quantum ecosystem, now and
into the future
• be bold and ambitious in supporting the growth of new quantum infrastructure,
including building the world’s first error‑corrected quantum computer in Australia.
Immediate actions
Action 2.1
Conduct a national audit of quantum‑related infrastructure enabling quantum research. The audit will identify
capability gaps and areas for dedicated investment, including access to quantum computing capabilities.
Action 2.2
Actively monitor supply chain challenges and opportunities affecting Australia’s quantum industries and move
to address these wherever possible.
What we’ve heard
Australian researchers, start‑ups and quantum businesses need advanced infrastructure, materials and tools
to build a thriving quantum ecosystem across research, development and manufacturing.
Infrastructure and material needs differ across the quantum sector. For example:
• accessing existing quantum computing capabilities could help develop use cases for quantum technologies
• growing and effectively using existing manufacturing facilities will help translate research into applications
• access to flexible fabrication plants may help quantum researchers and start‑ups access cheaper components
and grow.
Reliable access to resilient and trusted domestic and international supply chains is also essential for a successful
Australian quantum sector. Quantum technologies use mass‑produced components, such as semiconductors, that
are in high demand across the world. They also need bespoke components that are available from single sources
or specialist manufacturers.
The Australian quantum industry relies on complex global supply chains for key materials and components.
These complex global supply chains are vulnerable to disruption, resulting in unpredictable availability and costs.
Australia could analyse future supply chain needs and identify areas where it can become a world leader, helping
grow ongoing supply in the future.
Action impacts
These immediate actions address the challenges and opportunities identified in this strategy by:
• improving access to advanced infrastructure, materials and tools. This will drive growth and ensure Australia’s
quantum ecosystem’s needs are met now and in the future
• providing more shared quantum infrastructure for research, development and domestic manufacturing
• growing a strong local quantum industry with sovereign capability and expertise to drive economic growth,
productivity and jobs
• capitalising on our world‑class infrastructure to make Australia an attractive destination for international talent.

Case study: Access to infrastructure enables quantum start‑ups
Analog Quantum Circuits (AQC) is an Australian quantum start‑up focused on superconducting quantum
hardware. AQC is based on research in superconducting microwave devices, which was supported by the
Australian Research Council through Future Fellowships and the ARC Centre of Excellence in Engineered
Quantum Systems (EQUS).
AQC’s establishment faced 2 major challenges commonly experienced by other start‑ups seeking to
commercialise university research. AQC experienced difficulties in securing access to university‑held
intellectual property that underpins their research and development. They also experienced challenges
accessing the necessary facilities for fabrication, process control and cryogenic measurement to undertake
development of advanced hardware.
Gaps in the research and development pipeline create challenges for AQC and other start‑ups seeking to
become operational. For example, there are currently no openly accessible industry cryogenic measurement
facilities in Australia available for use by quantum technology companies. Where advanced facilities do
exist, access can be costly and have long lead times. While universities host some equipment that is industry
accessible, this does not cover the full range of requirements for a vibrant quantum technology industry.

Research infrastructure
The Australian Government has invested in a range of research infrastructure, some of which could be used
to improve access for quantum researchers and businesses.
The National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS) is maintaining Australia’s position as a global
research leader by ensuring researchers can access cutting‑edge infrastructure. Continuing to invest in NCRIS,
guided by the 2021 National Research Infrastructure Roadmap, will ensure this infrastructure evolves to meet
the needs of quantum researchers.
Current NCRIS projects that could improve access for quantum researchers include the following:
• Australian National Fabrication Facility, which provides open access micro‑ and nanofabrication for Australian
researchers in 8 nodes across Queensland, NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia. Each node
has expertise in a specific area, such as advanced materials, bionanotechnology applications, or nanoelectronics
and photonics. This can help researchers develop new products and improve current production methods.
• Heavy Ion Accelerators, which provides ion implantation and ion beam analysis services to national and
international researchers. This includes researchers working closely with industry in quantum computing,
photovoltaics, nano‑photonics and microelectronics.
• Microscopy Australia, which provides infrastructure that has helped investigate nanowires made from
a new material called indium arsenide.
• The Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre and National Computational Infrastructure Australia
supercomputer, which have provided modelling to support nano‑level research.
• The Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre, which recently installed a room‑temperature
diamond‑based quantum accelerator that will be used to demonstrate and test hybrid models
of quantum and classical computing.

Case study: Transitioning from the lab to future applications
Phasor Innovation is an Australian quantum business specialising in:
• radio frequency and microwave engineering
• electromagnetics
• system integration
• quantum technologies.
Phasor Innovation is collaborating with the University of Melbourne and RMIT University on researching and
developing the next generation of diamond‑based quantum sensors. There are a range of new and emerging
applications for this technology in many areas including the defence, mining, space and medical sectors.
The collaborative university and industry team successfully competed in the inaugural Army Quantum
Technology Challenge in 2021 and are currently working together on a subsequent project to design,
construct, test and evaluate a quantum diamond‑based vector magnetometer that will provide improved
surveillance and detection of subterranean targets. The team has also received funding from Defence
to further develop the technology for precision magnetic navigation in GNSSdenied environments.

Theme 3: A skilled and growing quantum
workforce
The Australian Government will:
• promote Australia as the world’s top destination for people studying,
undertaking research in and working in quantum industries
• cement Australia’s status as a high‑value location for companies establishing
their own quantum‑related capabilities.
Immediate actions
Action 3.1
Deliver the National Quantum Collaboration Initiative and quantum technology talent PhD scholarships,
to lay the foundations for a nation‑wide model for academic collaboration.
Action 3.2
Release a quantum workforce report, including modelling to identify workforce and educational needs for our
quantum sector and adjacent industries. The report will include skills taxonomies for quantum professionals and
other adjacent occupations.
Action 3.3
Integrate quantum science into programs growing STEM awareness in schools, universities and VET, in collaboration
with federal, state and territory education bodies. This will strengthen pathways and promote uptake into quantum
and adjacent careers and will include initiatives to lift the participation of women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
people and other underrepresented groups.
Action 3.4
Explore measures to attract global quantum talent and position Australia as a top destination to build a thriving
quantum career. This includes actively promoting Australia as a destination for professionals in quantum and
adjacent industries, including through targeted incentives, skilled migration and talent attraction programs.
What we’ve heard
A strong and vibrant Australian quantum sector requires a skilled, diverse and growing workforce.
The types of skills required will reach beyond physics into many different fields, including:
• machining
• electrical engineering
• software development and quantum algorithm research
• teaching
• science communication
• management
• cross‑sectoral applications.
32
Meeting our current and future quantum skills needs requires a pipeline of talent from schools, through universities
and vocational training and into industry. We need to develop and promote quantum career paths that make current
workers and school students aware of the diverse and engaging opportunities in the industry.
We can capitalise on Australia’s established strengths to grow a local quantum ecosystem. Australia’s research
excellence in universities and industry has established us as an international quantum leader. These researchers
will be the cornerstone of our future quantum industry.
We have a long history of collaborating on research into social and economic priorities through Centres of
Excellence. Our research strengths are in part due to decades of government funding in fundamental and applied
quantum science.
Our quantum sector can significantly contribute to Australia’s future prosperity. The sector is forecast to generate
over 16,000 jobs by 2040, and this number will grow with additional investment.
The Australian Government has a target of 1.2 million technology jobs by 2030, which will support the quantum
industry’s requirements. But we need more than quantum experts – we need quantum literate businesses and workers
across sectors, including manufacturing and engineering. We also need businesses that can identify and use new
quantum applications.
Building a quantum talent pipeline is a long‑term effort. We first need to assess our current, emerging and
future quantum skills needs and consider how we can meet our short‑, medium‑ and long‑term skills gaps.
In the short‑to medium‑term, we need to increase quantum literacy in schools and highlight quantum career
opportunities to secondary students and other workers.
We also need to lift diversity and inclusion in the industry. This will:
• bring new ideas and insights
• reduce bias in the system
• ensure we’re reflecting the views of Australia’s diverse society
• be essential to reaching the government’s technology jobs target.
In the long term, we must inspire more children to choose STEM and quantum education and careers. Bringing
quantum into the classroom and engaging children at an early age will encourage a new generation of students
to pursue quantum and related careers.
Australian research institutes and quantum companies must compete with other countries for the best and brightest
minds. Creating a thriving and trusted domestic ecosystem is essential for retaining Australia’s talent. We need
to promote Australia as a destination for international talent and promote the key capabilities that will let local
industries succeed.
Action impacts
These immediate actions address the challenges and opportunities identified in this strategy, by:
• promoting Australia as the world’s top destination for talent. This will address skills shortages that are a barrier
to growth
• building a skilled, diverse and growing talent pipeline to support well‑paying jobs, job growth and prosperity
in quantum and related industries
• strengthening Australian’s sovereign capability
• cementing Australia’s status as a desirable location for quantum companies by capitalising on our local talent
and research excellence.
3333
Jobs and Skills Summit
At the 2022 Jobs and Skills Summit, the Australian Government committed to implementing a Digital and Tech
Skills Compact. The compact will see the government work with industry, training and education providers,
unions and others on practical measures meet Australia’s digital and tech skills shortage.
A focus of the compact is developing an ‘earn while you learn’ scheme or ‘digital apprenticeship’.
This will bring workforce entrants into tech‑related roles and improve the diversity of the tech workforce.
Case study: Inspiring students
As part of the STEM 2022 on demand series, Sydney Quantum Academy (SQA) and the NSW Department
of Education created a video showing teachers how to light a path to a quantum career for their students.
The video explains that the era of quantum computing is fast approaching and covers some of the potential
applications for emerging quantum technology.
By clearly explaining our quantum future and the sector’s growing need for diverse skills, the video can
help teachers inspire a new generation of students. The video is part of a wider campaign and activities SQA
runs in partnership with several organisations including a summer school, open days and a careers fair.

Case study: Building a
quantum career
The past 7 years have seen a flurry
of challenges for 22 year‑old Ritika
Bazzad. Despite this, she’s overcome
obstacles – including a global
pandemic – and is now deep into a
PhD on quantum materials.
Her first obstacle was integrating
into a new country halfway through
a school year. When she arrived in
Australia from her native India in 2014
and, due to the different start dates
for academic years, she had to repeat
Year 10.
After graduating high school, her
father suggested Ritika consider
science, leading to an applied
physics degree at the University of
Technology Sydney (UTS). Then she
heard about Sydney Quantum Academy (SQA),
a partnership between 4 universities – Macquarie
University, University of Sydney, UNSW and UTS
– backed by the NSW Government. SQA provides
scholarships, career development and a thriving local
community of young researchers.

edge of quantum science and technology from both a theory as
well as a practical perspective.
Ritika’s research – in the Quantum Materials and Photonics
Team at UTS – is focused on nanomaterials, artificial structures
just billionths of a metre in size. At that scale, matter displays
quantum effects that can be manipulated.
She is experimenting with hexagonal boron nitride (or hBN) crystals
so they can better emit single photons (or particles of light). If it can
be perfected, it could lead to semiconductor chips just one atom
thick, opening the door to advanced 2D quantum state engineering.
35
Theme 4: Standards and frameworks
that support national interests
The Australian government will:
• be an active participant in global standards‑setting bodies to promote
the development of standards that support a thriving, accessible and safe
quantum ecosystem
• ensure Australia’s regulatory frameworks foster quantum‑related research,
support investment in quantum companies and support exports while protecting
Australia’s national interests.
Immediate actions
Action 4.1
Work across government to ensure that regulatory measures and frameworks are fit for purpose to maximise
opportunities and manage risks while protecting Australia’s national interests.
Action 4.2
Explore options to strengthen collaboration and opportunity for industry with our established partners through
existing arrangements and potential partnership arrangements, including AUKUS, the Quad, and other regional
and special bilateral agreements.
Identify and consider opportunities to grow Australia’s regional leadership through collaborative programs of
research, science diplomacy and provisioning access to infrastructure.
What we’ve heard
Quantum technologies could give Australia enormous commercial and sovereign capability advantages.
We must protect Australia’s national interests while taking full advantage of the opportunities for Australia’s
quantum researchers and industry.
36
We need to ensure responsible use of quantum technologies. Appropriate controls of these technologies will
help protect our research, capabilities and investments.
Australia’s regulatory environment:
• provides strong protections
• ensures fair competition
• supports national interests
• promotes integrity in the market.
This effective regulatory environment gives certainty to businesses, investors and international partners
looking to work with Australia. It also ensures our approach to technologies aligns with our values.
These regulatory frameworks need to remain fit for purpose and responsive to technological developments.
This will ensure trust and confidence for investors and support Australia’s national interests.
Developing and using quantum technologies could have significant implications for our national security.
These technologies could impact some of our most important national security functions including:
• defence
• intelligence
• encryption
• sensing and detection
• computer processing
• communications.
To increase our resilience, we will need to monitor the development of quantum technologies and their potential
impacts on public safety and cyber security. We must address national security challenges and capitalise on
opportunities for our exports, capabilities, researchers and companies. Australian academia and industry can
contribute to our defence and national security by discovering and building new quantum capabilities. To fully
realise those opportunities, we need strong and trusted Australian quantum companies.
Our stakeholders told us that navigating the regulatory environment can be a challenge for advanced and emerging
technology industries, including quantum. For example, the necessary focus on mitigating risks and protecting our
knowledge and capabilities can inhibit growth and commercial opportunities. Australian technology companies don’t
have a large domestic market, which makes access to international markets critical for their survival and growth.
Actions impact
These immediate actions address the challenges and opportunities identified in this strategy, by:
• supporting a thriving, accessible and safe quantum ecosystem by considering regulatory frameworks,
red tape and other barriers to exports and overseas investment
• supporting investment and exports while protecting Australia’s national security by strengthening
collaboration with trusted international partners
• capitalising on Australia’s economic and strategic opportunities in quantum technologies.

the University of Adelaide, QuantX Labs is developing groundbreaking quantum sensors and clocks.
These critical capabilities will:
• enhance Australia’s security through better undersea and underground surveillance
as well as opening the door to next‑generation over‑the‑horizon radar technologies
• support deployments of the Australian Defence Forces through enhanced navigation
and surveillance capabilities
• allow civilian and defence operations in regions in which satellite navigation systems are unavailable
• provide support for critical civilian and defence infrastructure.

Case study: Army Quantum
Technology Challenge
The Army Quantum Technology Challenge
(AQTC) is an annual technology challenge
and the flagship initiative of Army’s Quantum
Technology Roadmap.
The AQTC is designed to leverage Australia’s
national strategic strength in quantum
technology to rapidly identify the most
disruptive and advantageous applications
of quantum technologies for the land domain, while
also stimulating the growth of the sovereign quantum
industry that will deliver those capabilities to the Army.
Each year, the AQTC challenges teams to demonstrate solutions to one of three
challenge themes, which span quantum sensing, computing and communications.
The themes are derived from:
• current Army problems
• Army hypotheses about transformative effects that quantum technologies Chief of the Army,
may have on land warfare Lieutenant General
Simon Stuart, AO,
• input from the quantum technology community.

Past themes have included: Quantum Technology
• subterranean imaging and locating electromagnetic emitters using Challenge. Credit:
quantum sensors Australian Army
• optimising last‑mile resupply logistics and enhancing image processing
using quantum computers
• the disruption of satellite‑mediated quantum communications and the
implementation of post‑quantum cryptography to harden the Army’s
communications against attack from quantum computers.
To participate, teams propose a solution concept and undergo a selection
process. Selected teams then receive seed funding to develop their solution over
approximately 5 months before demonstrating it at the AQTC Demonstration Day.
Since quantum technologies are diverse in technology readiness, demonstrations
range from simulations to deployable prototypes.
Demonstration Day is a major event that is held in conjunction with the Chief of Army
Symposium and the Army Robotics Expo. It provides the teams with the opportunity
to interact with the full spectrum of junior soldiers to senior Defence leaders, and for
those members to gain a tangible understanding of quantum technologies and their
defence implications. At Demonstration Day, the teams are assessed by an evaluation
panel drawn from across the services and groups and Army’s strategic partners.
The top‑ranked teams are offered the opportunity to further develop their solution
under significant Army Quantum Technology Exploit Projects. Being awarded an
Exploit Project contract is the principal incentive for the teams. The projects are
designed to bridge the gap from technology demonstrator to a field‑deployable
prototype that is ready for adoption by a land capability program.
Since commencing in 2021, the AQTC has achieved significant outcomes, including:
• the identification of the profound and near‑term advantages offered by quantum
sensors in subterranean imaging
• the innovation of countermeasures to these sensors by Army soldiers
• the Army’s strategic partners identifying immediate opportunities to pursue with
Australian industry.

Theme 5: A trusted, ethical and
inclusive quantum ecosystem
The Australian Government will:
• ensure that the growth of Australia’s quantum ecosystem supports
economic prosperity while safeguarding national wellbeing
• champion responsible innovation and the introduction of new standards
and regulatory mechanisms where national wellbeing is at risk.
Immediate actions
Action 5.1
Work with industry, academia and states and territories to develop principles to support the responsible
and inclusive development and use of quantum technologies.
Action 5.2
Ensure that Australia is actively represented in international quantum standards‑setting bodies.
Continue to work with industry to boost participation in international quantum standards development.
What we’ve heard
Quantum technologies present nearly endless opportunities. But these opportunities must serve the interests of
Australian society and contribute to our national wellbeing. The public is increasingly aware of the ethical and social
implications of new technologies, and we should not assume they will enthusiastically embrace quantum technologies.
By building principles for responsible development and use, quantum researchers and developers can develop
technologies that align to Australian values and expectations and protect human rights. By adopting this approach,
Australia can cement itself as a responsible technology developer and attract international companies and investors.
Standards for quantum technologies will give Australians confidence these technologies are being developed and
deployed in a way that is trusted, secure and to their benefit. Technology standards and trusted measurement will
help grow the sector by creating a competitive supplier market. This will give industry confidence to adopt new
technologies and ensure global interoperability.
Standards will provide consistency and opportunities to Australian companies looking to develop or use this
technology. With industry leading the way, Australia can have an active role in the global bodies that develop
technology standards. This will help ensure that standards for quantum technologies support the growth of
a vibrant and competitive marketplace by fostering interoperability, innovation, transparency and security.
The government will continue prioritising Australia’s representation in international quantum standards‑setting
bodies and developing principles for responsible and inclusive development and use. This work is consistent with
our international obligations and the principles of Australia’s international cyber and critical technology engagement.
We will also ensure that developing and adopting these standards doesn’t unnecessarily inhibit research,
development and commercialisation of quantum technologies.
To maximise the opportunities of quantum, we must push for greater inclusion and diversity. This includes increasing
the participation of women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and other underrepresented groups.
The quantum community must engage with rural and regional Australia and connect with families, teachers and
children. That way, the whole of Australia can understand and benefit from quantum technologies.
The quantum industry will also play an important role in improving diversity and inclusion. This includes reducing
the gender pay gap and supporting women’s participation, particularly in senior positions.
Action impacts
These immediate actions address the challenges and opportunities identified in this strategy, by:
• ensuring the growth of Australia’s quantum ecosystem aligns with and protects Australian values,
human rights and national wellbeing
• championing responsible innovation by designing frameworks for the responsible development
and use of quantum technologies
• actively engaging with international standards development forums to represent Australia’s interests
• positioning Australia as a destination for talent and capital investment.

Case study: Contributing
to global quantum
governance
Growing Australia’s place in and
contribution to the international
quantum ecosystem has been
enabled through our participation
in the development of world‑first
governance guidelines for
quantum computing.
In 2021, the World Economic
Forum established
a multi‑stakeholder
network centred on the
acceleration of responsible
quantum computing.
This took place as the ethical,
legal and social implications of quantum
computing were just beginning to be discussed
globally. But there was wide recognition there were
no established governance guidelines available that would guide
the development and use of the technology for broader social good.
Over the course of a year, the forum coordinated a comprehensive multi‑stage
co‑design process involving:
• quantum science and technology experts
• business leaders
• social scientists
• policymakers
• authorities on emerging technology ethics and law drawn from around
the world.
Australian expertise was broadly represented and participants in the
development of these guidelines came from CSIRO, the Sydney Quantum
Academy, the Australian National University, the University of Western Australia,
The University of Queensland, Monash University and Quintessence Labs.
The Australian participants worked alongside other key quantum experts and
stakeholders across research and development, government and industry sectors
across the globe to tackle early‑stage questions about how to not only assess and
manage the opportunities of quantum, but also the potential risks so that they
might be mitigated.
The process set the course for looking at the long‑term futures that we most
wanted to create with quantum computing and created a set of actionable principles
that can be debated, refined and used to collaboratively shape how the technology
will be used.

Strategic approach
The National Quantum Strategy is integral to the Australian Government’s agenda to build a stronger economy
and create sustainable, well‑paid jobs.
The strategy is also part of the government’s framework for critical technologies. Critical technology priorities
are diverse, with different skills, research, infrastructure and commercialisation challenges and opportunities.
They have benefits and uses across the economy. Investing in and supporting capabilities such as quantum
is essential to boosting productivity and fostering a resilient, innovative economy.
The strategy reflects the role of government in leading investment and policies that help businesses harness
emerging technologies. This includes:
• creating the environment for businesses to harness emerging technologies
• creating regulations that build trust, increase confidence and support growth
• providing national leadership and policy coordination
• investing and using financial incentives where appropriate, including by adopting these technologies early.
The government’s investments in the quantum sector must maximise the benefit to industry and minimise market
distortions. Investments should:
• have the potential to significantly impact Australia’s quantum sector or the broader economy
• align with government priorities and Australia’s economic, social and national interests
• counter market failures, address financing impediments and support the commercialisation of the sector,
including with infrastructure that will help the industry scale
• make use of contributions from other sources, such as:
– international industry and investors
– academia or research organisations
– quantum industry
– quantum technology end users
– state and territory governments
– international governments
– existing programs such as grant programs and specialist investment vehicles.
43
Working together to deliver
To achieve this vision, we need a truly national effort from Australia’s entire quantum ecosystem. This includes:
• all states and territories
• the education sector
• the technology and manufacturing industry
• businesses and investors
• the broader Australian community.
The Australian Government and research sector have led the way. The government has been investing in quantum
for over 20 years, helping build a strong foundation in quantum information, science and technology. We can build
on this foundation by coordinating our efforts and investing further to grow Australia’s skilled workforce, businesses,
infrastructure, partnerships and capabilities.
The Department of Industry, Science and Resources leads the development and implementation of the strategy.
We will work with partners across government, including the:
• Department of Education
• Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, including Austrade
• Department of Home Affairs
• Department of Defence
• Department of Employment and Workplace Relations
• Treasury.

Measuring our success
To ensure we deliver on the ambition of this strategy, we will regularly review the sector’s progress. Starting in 2023,
we will run periodic benchmarking reviews. These reviews will track Australia’s performance using quantitative and
qualitative indicators of achievement.

Appendix: Categories of
quantum technologies
Quantum technologies and materials will be used across sectors and shape many areas of our economy.
They can bring significant economic, productivity, social and environmental benefits.
There are 3 main categories of quantum technologies: sensing, computers and communications.
Quantum sensing
Quantum sensing allows us to detect and map objects through barriers, in unique ways and at distances with extreme precision.
Applications for quantum sensors include enhanced imaging, passive navigation, precise timing and remote sensing.
This may help us to:
• map and understand the brain, the heart and other organs, as well as transform the way we detect and diagnose disease
• detect mineral deposits deeper underground without needing to dig
• find leaks and other issues in underground pipes and cables
• navigate with greater accuracy. More accurate position, navigation and timing systems are important for emerging
technologies such as self‑driving cars and military capabilities.
Quantum computers
Quantum computers use quantum mechanics to perform complex calculations using less steps than an ordinary computer.
Quantum computers work by creating a superposition of lots of different possible solutions to a problem, encoded in qubits.
They then manipulate that superposition so that wrong solutions cancel out and right ones are strengthened.
By harnessing these capabilities, quantum computers could:
• optimise logistics to deliver our parcels faster and more accurately
• improve the efficiency of our public transport networks
• model probabilities of extreme weather events and complex health challenges like pandemics
• model optimal responses to emergencies like fires and floods
• simulate complex molecules that could be used in advanced materials (such as the best structure and material composition
for aeroplanes) and clean technologies like batteries
• model chemical and drug reactions, which can drastically speed up medical research for new medicines and vaccines
• improve earth observation from space to more precisely observe parameters for disaster resilience and climate change.
Quantum communications
Quantum communications may enable faster and more secure communications networks. Applications include:
• transferring information between quantum computers
• Sharing cryptographic keys between distant people in a way that makes them impossible for anyone else to copy.
Through quantum communications we can:
• drive the next generation of cyber security and secure communications
• create high‑speed networks, including a future quantum internet, that will deliver a host of new applications
• enable distributed quantum computing, increasing computing power.
Post‑quantum cryptography (also called quantum‑resistant cryptography) is a cryptographic system that is secure against
both quantum and classical computers. It can interoperate with existing communications protocols and networks.

Executive
summary
Advances in quantum science have the potential to transform how people
work and live in Canada and around the world. Canada’s investments in
quantum technologies and research over many decades have made the
country a global leader in the field, with a growing ecosystem of world-class centres
of quantum expertise in universities and businesses across the country. As the rest of
the world expands its own quantum programs, Canada must continue to invest and
innovate if it is to stay ahead.
Three key missions Next steps

PILLARS OF THE NATIONAL QUANTUM STRATEGY
To support the NQS missions and Canada’s broader quantum ecosystem, the strategy is underpinned by three
interrelated pillars for a successful Canadian quantum community: Research, Talent and Commercialization. By
coordinating investments and outcomes across all three, Canada can strengthen its quantum advantage and
build a leading quantum science, technology development, supply chain and applications ecosystem. Current
and future actions under each pillar will support the realization of the NQS missions.

ISED is exploring ways it can apply Canada’s Industrial and Technological Benefits (ITB) Policy to drive greater
quantum technology-related business activities into Canada. The ITB Policy is Canada’s primary tool to leverage
economic benefits from defence and major Canadian Coast Guard procurements. It is market-oriented and
requires companies awarded defence contracts to undertake business activity in Canada equal to the value
of the contract they have been awarded. The types of business activities involving quantum technologies that
could currently qualify for credit under the ITB Policy align well with the policy’s value proposition pillars of
R&D, and skills development and training.
In addition to the Government of Canada programs in the NQS, there are a number of additional federal
initiatives that are playing, or can play, a significant role in supporting the Canadian quantum industry, including:

Editorial
Les technologies quantiques nous projettent dans la France de 2030,
celle que nous construisons à travers France Relance et les
investissements d’avenir : un monde où les performances des
ordinateurs seront fulgurantes et la sensibilité des capteurs extrêmes, un
monde où nous pourrons identifier très rapidement le remède à un agent
pathogène, simuler des molécules, décrypter des messages aujourd’hui
indéchiffrables et communiquer de façon parfaitement sécurisée.
Une nouvelle révolution technologique se profile et la France y prendra
toute sa part. Pour viser haut, nos regards doivent porter loin. Si, dans la
gestion d’une crise sanitaire, la réactivité compte, les forces profondes
d’un pays se construisent au minimum sur des années, sinon des
décennies. Ce temps long du travail scientifique, cette anticipation que
demandent la découverte et l’expérimentation, est au cœur de notre
Emmanuel Macron politique d’investissement dans la recherche et le développement
Président de la République
technologique.
Française
Aujourd’hui la France a toutes les clefs en main pour ouvrir les portes de
l’innovation quantique. L’excellence de notre tradition scientifique
évidemment. La qualité de nos formations. Des femmes et des hommes
de talent. Un écosystème scientifique, entrepreneurial et industriel en
pleine effervescence. Des acteurs qui bâtissent entre leurs compétences
des ponts qui les rendent plus forts. De fait, dans la course à ces
nouvelles technologies, nous sommes en très bonne place. Et nous
allons encore forcer l’allure.
La stratégie quantique de la France donnera un grand coup
d’accélérateur aux formations, aux recherches scientifiques et aux
expérimentations technologiques, tout en renforçant les chaînes de
valeur industrielles. Avec ce plan, nous entendons asseoir durablement
la France dans le premier cercle des pays qui maîtrisent les technologies
quantiques. Il s’agit de rien moins que de conquérir notre souveraineté
dans ce domaine technologique qui façonnera le futur.
Cet élan s’accompagne d’une responsabilité, que nous portons en
conscience, pour que cette révolution quantique bénéficie au bien
commun, car elle est pleine de promesses pour l’avenir, pour notre santé,
notre sécurité, nos communications. La France, pionnière de la
recherche dans le domaine, se donne ainsi toutes les chances de saisir
l’opportunité technologique qui s’ouvre à elle.
Cette stratégie, qui représente un engagement global de 1,8 Mds€,
nécessitera un effort cumulé de l’Etat de près de 1 Md€ à l’horizon 2025,
et comprend des financements européens et industriels.
Au-delà de cette dynamique nationale puissante, la France cherchera à
entraîner d’autres pays européens, dont l’Allemagne et les Pays-Bas,
vers un horizon commun, avec l’ambition de faire de l’Europe le centre
de gravité mondial des technologies quantiques.
Au cœur de cette crise, je crois profondément que nous devons agir,
penser, chercher en explorateurs, en inventeurs, en pionniers, en
poursuivant la grande épopée européenne de l’esprit scientifique.
Nous avons toutes les raisons d’y croire.
Editorial
Dans le contexte de relance globale, la France peut et doit se positionner
à la pointe des technologies qui feront le monde de demain. Par le déport
avant sans précédent qu’elles annoncent, les technologies quantiques
constituent à la fois une menace et une opportunité.
Bien qu’encore exigeantes à mettre en œuvre, les premières applications
nous laissent entrevoir les immenses capacités des ordinateurs, réseaux
de communication et capteurs quantiques, dont la maitrise conférerait un
avantage stratégique, souvent rêvé en terme de ‘suprématie’, mais
pourtant bien réel pour les Etats qui en disposeraient, et constituerait une

Ministre des Armées
C’est l’ampleur hors-norme du défi de souveraineté auquel nous sommes
confrontés, et que la France a choisi de relever avec sa stratégie
quantique. En s’appuyant sur l’héritage d’une recherche d’excellence
dans le domaine, d’un écosystème industriel favorable et d’une ardeur
entrepreneuriale enthousiasmante, cette stratégie donne des moyens et
un sens commun dans la durée aux multiples acteurs de cette
communauté, pour ancrer et pérenniser la France dans le premier cercle
des puissances quantiques.
Ce sera une aventure scientifique et intellectuelle captivante, dont
émergera une nouvelle discipline à la croisée des sciences physiques,

informatiques, et des mathématiques, qui devra surmonter de nombreux
Ministre de l’Économie,
des Finances et de la verrous conceptuels et techniques aux frontières de notre maitrise de la
Relance matière. Ce sera également un parcours technologique et industriel
structurant, au cœur des actions que nous mènerons dans les 5
prochaines années, avec l’objectif permanent de créer de la valeur
économique, durablement adossée à une filière industrielle complète,
aux talents que nous formerons et aux nouveaux emplois qui en
découleront.
Nous porterons de toutes nos forces cet élan, pour qu’il contribue à créer
une dynamique européenne féconde, et que les technologies quantiques
rejoignent la liste des réalisations fondatrices de notre histoire commune,
lorsque nous sommes alignés au meilleur de nous-même.

Le quantique :
un « Big Bang » technologique
Le raccourcissement des temps de calcul d’un facteur de un milliard, qu’apporteront les ordinateurs
quantiques d’ici 5 à 10 ans, constitue une rupture technologique majeure. L’industrie bénéficiera de
nouveaux outils de simulation et d’optimisation avec des impacts sociétaux importants, notamment en
matière de santé, environnement ou énergie, grâce à la possibilité de simuler dynamiquement les mo-
lécules et leur action, ouvrant une nouvelle ère de la chimie, ou encore de prédire finement les propa-
gations épidémiques ou d’optimiser le trafic de manière systémique en temps réel. Par ailleurs, les
techniques d’ultra-refroidissement des atomes permettront de dépasser la précision de nos horloges
atomiques et les capteurs quantiques bouleverseront nos futurs champs de bataille, en apportant de
nouvelles fonctionnalités de navigation sans satellite, ou encore des capacités de détection inédites.
Les technologies quantiques représentent des enjeux de compétitivité et de souveraineté importants et
nous serons demain en difficulté si nous ne disposions pas à terme de capacités technologiques propres
dans le domaine ou si nous n’adaptions pas nos outils à ces nouvelles réalités. La puissance des ordi-
nateurs quantiques permettrait par exemple, à qui en bénéficie le premier et en aurait l’intention, de
casser de manière unilatérale les clefs de chiffrement aujourd’hui inviolables, notamment celles qui sont
basées sur le protocole de chiffrement RSA, utilisé par exemple pour nos payements sécurisés par
carte bleue. C’est pourquoi il est crucial de se protéger de ce type de menaces avec des mesures
cryptographiques appropriées, et d’en éprouver la robustesse avec nos propres moyens de calcul quan-
tiques.
Les technologies et ordinateurs quantiques confèreront à moyen terme un avantage stratégique certain
aux acteurs économiques qui s’en seront saisis. Au regard des enjeux de croissance économique et de
souveraineté, et à l’instar des principales grandes puissances mondiales, les Etats-Unis, la Chine, le
Royaume-Uni ou l’Allemagne, nous mettons aujourd’hui en place un programme national ambitieux : la
France a les moyens de saisir l’opportunité des technologies quantiques et de devenir un leader mondial
en la matière.
Aujourd’hui, la France possède les principaux atouts pour s’imposer comme un compétiteur scientifique
et industriel majeur dans les technologies quantiques, notamment grâce au positionnement historique
de sa recherche sur différentes briques technologiques clefs allant du composant à l’usage, mais aussi
de ses industriels précurseurs et de son écosystème dynamique de startups.
En se fondant sur ces atouts, la stratégie quantique doit permettre à la France d’entrer dans le premier
cercle des pays qui maîtrisent les technologies quantiques. Fortement systémique, cette stratégie vise
à enrichir et affirmer notre capabilité sur le plan scientifique et technologique, mais aussi dans les
chaînes de valeur industrielles, le développement du capital humain ou encore l’anticipation des besoins
de compétences pour ces marchés, en doublant progressivement le vivier de spécialistes à l’horizon
2025, afin de garantir et pérenniser notre indépendance dans ce domaine technologique qui façonnera
le futur.

Les impacts socio-économiques
Mieux se soigner
A l’heure où les supercalculateurs du monde
entier sont mobilisés pour rechercher un re-
mède adapté au Coronavirus, les ordinateurs
quantiques pourraient devenir l’un des outils
les plus puissants jamais conçus pour lutter
contre les crises sanitaires, permettant d’iden-
tifier très rapidement le remède à un agent pa-
thogène.
Dès aujourd’hui, plusieurs start-ups quan-
tiques, dont certaines en France, développent
des solutions logicielles hybrides entre super-
calculateurs et ordinateurs quantiques pour
découvrir de nouvelles thérapies. Avec un ordinateur quantique, nous pourrons faire de la simulation
avancée et ainsi concevoir des médicaments non plus de manière empirique, mais de façon détermi-
niste. Les ordinateurs quantiques pourraient également fournir la puissance d'analyse nécessaire pour
prédire la propagation d’un agent pathogène avant qu’il ne se transforme en épidémie.
Mieux se nourrir
Le procédé « Haber-Bosch » de fixation de l'azote pour la fabrication d'engrais à base d’ammoniac,
commercialisé en 1913 et toujours utilisé de nos jours, a fortement contribué à l'éradication de la famine
des pays développés. Néanmoins, en faisant intervenir des conditions de température et de pression
extrêmes, ce procédé reste très énergivore.
Depuis des décennies, les chimistes tentent d'améliorer l'efficacité énergétique de ce processus. Grace
à leur capacité à simuler efficacement des interactions physiques et chimiques au niveau atomique, les
ordinateurs quantiques pourraient contribuer à l’identification d’un catalyseur bio-inspiré efficace pour
la production d’ammoniac dans des conditions normales de température et de pression. Des travaux de
recherche menés sur ce sujet ont démontré qu’il suffirait d’une heure de calcul à un ordinateur quantique
de quelques centaines de qubits pour résoudre ce problème. Ceci pourrait être atteint dans les pro-
chaines années.
Avec 3 % de la production mondiale de gaz naturel utilisée pour le procédé Haber-Bosch, nous dépen-
sons chaque année 11 Mds€ en gaz naturel, et émettons 7,6 Mds de tonnes de CO pour créer de
2
l'ammoniac destiné à produire des engrais. En contribuant à réduire l’empreinte énergétique de produc-
tion d’engrais, le calcul quantique pourrait alors offrir des perspectives substantielles d'économies et de
réduction de l’impact écologique de l’industrie agroalimentaire.
6
Mieux combattre le changement climatique
et ses effets
Avec la santé et l’alimentation, la lutte contre le changement climatique est le domaine pour lequel
l’informatique quantique porte le plus d’espoirs pour les deux prochaines décennies. Le CO est natu-
2
rellement absorbé par les océans et la végétation. Néanmoins, la production humaine de CO dépasse
2
le taux d’absorption naturel depuis de nombreuses décennies. Une façon d’inverser cette tendance
consiste à capter le CO pour le retransformer en une molécule plus complexe.
2
Nous connaissons un ensemble de catalyseurs capables de capturer le CO , mais la plupart nécessitent
2
des métaux rares ou sont difficiles à produire et couteux à déployer. L’observation des processus bio-
logiques d’assimilation du CO , à l’image de la photosynthèse, conforte néanmoins l’idée qu’il puisse
2
exister des catalyseurs permettant de capturer facilement le CO à moindre coût. Cependant, trouver
2
un tel catalyseur est une tâche ardue sans la possibilité de simuler les propriétés moléculaires des
différents candidats.
Grâce à ses capacités de simulation de la dynamique moléculaire et de recherche dans les espaces
chimiques combinatoires immenses, les ordinateurs quantiques pourraient permettre d’identifier un pro-
cédé économiquement viable permettant un recyclage efficace du CO et une production de sous-pro-
2
duits d’intérêt à l’image de l'hydrogène ou du monoxyde de carbone.
Mieux anticiper les catastrophes naturelles
L’anticipation des catastrophes naturelles est le domaine où des capteurs quantiques embarqués dans
des satellites prennent tout leur sens, notamment dans le contexte de changement climatique dans
lequel nous vivons.
Le développement d’accéléromètres à atomes froids opérant dans des satellites en orbite basse pour-
ront mesurer les variations de champ de gravité causés notamment par la variation de répartition de
masses au sol. Cette répartition de masse peut avoir différentes causes en lien avec différents types de
catastrophes naturelles :
 Le chargement des nappes phréa-
tiques, signes avant-coureurs d’inondation
ou de sècheresse ;
 Le développement de biomasse, avec
le cycle saisonnier, dont la variabilité peut si-
gnaler des évolutions structurelles des éco-
systèmes ;
 Les mouvements de matière dans le
sous-sol, qui peuvent créer des contraintes
qui seront libérées lors de séismes.
Les informations collectées par ces capteurs pourront être précieuses pour anticiper et mieux gérer les
crises environnementales. Au-delà des capteurs, le traitement des informations ainsi collectées par les
futurs ordinateurs quantiques suffisamment puissants permettra de caractériser les signes avant-cou-
reurs de catastrophes naturelles.
7
Mieux se déplacer
Aux heures de pointe, de nombreux conducteurs demandent en même temps les itinéraires les plus
courts possibles, mais les services de navigation actuels traitent ces demandes de façon individuelle.
Ils ne prennent pas en considération le nombre de demandes similaires, y compris dans les zones où
d'autres conducteurs prévoient de partager les mêmes segments d'itinéraire. Avec des heures de départ
similaires, une application GPS individuelle qui donne à chacun la même route pour aller à destination,
créera inévitablement un engorgement au lieu de le fluidifier.
Que se passerait-il si nous pouvions développer un système de routage plus global – qui pourrait pren-
dre en compte toutes les différentes demandes d'itinéraires des conducteurs et optimiser les sugges-
tions d'itinéraires de manière à réduire au minimum le nombre de véhicules partageant les mêmes
routes ?
Cela pourrait faire gagner du temps à tout le monde. Néanmoins le nombre de facteurs en jeu – des
milliers de véhicules, des millions d'itinéraires et de destinations possibles – fait que même les super-
calculateurs n’ont pas une puissance de calcul suffisante pour trouver la solution optimale en temps
utile et optimiser le trafic à grande échelle.
Par leur aptitude à résoudre efficacement ce qui s’apparente au problème classique du « voyageur du
commerce », les ordinateurs quantiques pourraient fournir aux conducteurs des itinéraires équilibrés,
ce qui permettrait d’obtenir une circulation plus fluide, des trajets plus efficaces et même une réduction
de la pollution.
Mieux produire
La chimie est une discipline encore largement empirique. Bien que la « chimie théorique » s’attache à
décrire les mécanismes d'auto-assemblage et autres phénomènes en jeu dans les interactions, les chi-
mistes privilégient encore les règles heuristiques pour faire des prédictions sur le comportement d'une
molécule, d’un ensemble de molécules, ou d'un matériau.
En revanche, un ordinateur quantique permettrait de calculer avec précision le comportant des molé-
cules les plus grosses. Les ordinateurs quantiques pourraient détenir la clé de la puissance prédictive
qui fait défaut aux méthodes « classiques » de chimie théorique. En d'autres termes, les ordinateurs
quantiques pourraient faire passer la chimie de l’art des règles empiriques à une science fondée sur la
prédiction par la simulation numérique, ouvrant ainsi une nouvelle ère de cette discipline.
8
Mieux se protéger des menaces sur la sécurité
des communications
La cryptographie est utilisée pour as-
surer la confidentialité et l'intégrité des
communications face à des menaces
d'écoute ou de modification mal inten-
tionnée du trafic. Les mécanismes
asymétriques employés aujourd'hui,
tels que le RSA, seront menacés par
l'éventualité d’un ordinateur quantique
suffisamment puissant.
Face à cette menace, il est nécessaire
de mettre en œuvre de nouvelles mo-
dalités de sécurisation des communi-
cations. C'est le domaine de recherche de la cryptographie post-quantique. Remplacer les mécanismes
actuels par de nouveaux mécanismes résistants à l'ordinateur quantique permet de conserver inchan-
gée l'infrastructure actuelle de communications.
S’agissant des mécanismes de chiffrement symétriques, utilisés pour sécuriser les informations très
sensibles, rien ne permet d'affirmer, à l'heure actuelle, qu’ils seraient sérieusement menacés par les
ordinateurs quantiques.
Mieux se préparer aux conflits de demain
Dans une conflictualité moderne où la supériorité technologique reste un atout majeur sinon décisif, le
secteur de la défense exploite systématiquement les opportunités offertes par toutes les innovations,
pouvant elles être issues du monde civil.
La mise en œuvre par des puissances étrangères d’équipements et systèmes d’armes intégrant des
technologies quantiques leur confèrera un avantage stratégique. Or, ce renforcement de la puissance
doit conduire à adapter notre outil de défense, sous peine de déclassement. Même si la mise en œuvre
de solutions quantiques dans notre système de défense n’était pas recherchée, le plein investissement
de cette filière par les Etats étrangers nécessiterait une réponse. La cryptographie post-quantique il-
lustre très bien ce mécanisme.
Par ailleurs, les capteurs, la cryptographie, le calcul et les communications doivent faire l’objet d’un suivi
permanent afin d’anticiper, de détecter et de s’approprier toute évolution pouvant constituer un « game
changer » pour les opérations militaires.
Certaines applications, en particulier dans le domaine des capteurs et ordinateurs quantiques, ouvrent
des perspectives intéressantes pour la défense :
 La navigation inertielle quantique, notamment à atomes froids, permet de se positionner dans
l’espace sans les services de « Géolocalisation et Navigation par un Système de Satellites »
(GNSS). Ces technologies pourraient atteindre une maturité opérationnelle dans un délai de 5
à 10 ans ;
 En contexte de guerre électronique, une meilleure précision dans la mesure du temps/fré-
quence donne un avantage stratégique aux forces armées en matière d’interception électroma-
gnétique et de communications robustes. ;

Les atouts de la France dans la
course à l’ordinateur quantique
universel
La France dispose d’ atouts différenciants pour devenir l’une des premières nations à réaliser l’exploit
de développer un ordinateur quantique universel : l’excellence de sa recherche fondamentale en phy-
sique et en informatique (CNRS, INRIA, CEA, ONERA), ainsi que la force de frappe de sa recherche
technologique et industrielle (Atos, STMicro, AirLiquide, Orano, et l’écosystème de startups), notam-
ment dans les domaines de la microélectronique, des supercalculateurs et des technologies habili-
tantes.
En l’occurrence, la France est le berceau de plusieurs percées
majeures à l’origine de l’avance actuelle des grandes entre- Les qubits supraconducteurs uti-
prises technologiques mondiales. Par ailleurs, les technolo- lisés par Google et IBM et les qu-

La France dans la compétition internationale
L’ambition de la France est d’être parmi les premières nations à développer un ordinateur quantique
universel à grande échelle lui assurant une souveraineté technologique et contribuant à l’autonomie
stratégique de l’Europe. La France est l’un des rares pays capable de relever ce défi d’échelle. Néan-
moins, elle ne sera probablement pas la seule et devra composer avec les pays qui ont des commu-
nautés larges (eg. Chine et Etats-Unis) ou disposent également d’un plan national fort (Allemagne,
Pays-Bas, Royaume-Uni).
Avec cette stratégie, la France souhaite prendre le leadership dans l’émergence d’entreprises pouvant
devenir des leaders mondiaux des technologies quantiques., tout en renforçant les champions engagés
dans le domaine (Atos, Thales, Orange, STMicro, Air Liquide, Orano,…) pour créer une industrie com-
pétitive dans les domaines d’applications clés des technologies quantiques, avec des retombées di-
rectes dans la santé, l’énergie, le climat, l’agro-alimentaire, la pharmacie, la dissuasion et le renseigne-
ment.

Stratégie quantique :
5 ans pour asseoir la France
dans le premier cercle mondial
La stratégie quantique bénéficiera des investissements exceptionnels que le Gouvernement a décidé
de mener dans des secteurs et technologies d’avenir, pendant et après la relance, en mobilisant notam-
ment le 4e Programme d’investissements d’avenir (PIA4). Annoncées par le Gouvernement début jan-
vier, ces premières stratégies nationales répondent à des besoins d’innovation prioritaires ou des failles
de marché: l'Etat mobilise ainsi 12,5 milliards d'euros sur 5 ans à travers le PIA pour financer ces inves-
tissements, dont une partie dans le cadre du plan #FranceRelance. Le numérique y occupera une place
centrale : quantique, cybersécurité, intelligence artificielle, 5G…
Pour en savoir plus sur les stratégies d’accélération du Gouvernement :
https://www.gouvernement.fr/strategies-d-acceleration-pour-l-innovation
La stratégie doit permettre à la France d’être parmi les premiers pays à maîtriser les technologies quan-
tiques clés : accélérateurs et simulateurs quantiques, logiciels métiers pour le calcul quantique, capteurs
quantiques, communications quantiques, cryptographie post-quantique, technologies habilitantes, etc..
Dans le domaine du calcul, thème central de la stratégie, elle deviendra le premier Etat à disposer d’un
prototype complet d’ordinateur quantique généraliste de première génération dès 2023. Elle pourra éga-
lement s’affirmer comme la première nation à disposer d’une filière complète productrice de Si 28 in-
dustriel pour les besoins de la production de qubits sur Silicium.
Le délai de maturation de ces technologies, les couches logicielles à développer, ou la formation des
talents, requièrent de fédérer les acteurs et les efforts vers cette ambition de bâtir une filière industrielle
complète : il s’agit de s’affirmer durablement comme un leader du domaine, avec l’objectif de création
de 16 000 emplois directs à l’horizon 2030 et de représenter à terme entre 1 et 2 % des exportations
françaises.
Fortement systémique, la stratégie quantique vise à enrichir et affirmer notre capabilité sur le plan scien-
tifique et technologique, mais aussi dans les chaînes de valeur industrielles, le développement du capital
humain ou encore l’anticipation des besoins de compétences pour ces marchés, en doublant progres-
sivement le vivier de spécialistes à l’horizon 2025, afin de garantir et pérenniser notre souveraineté sur
ces technologies critiques.
Elle s’articule selon les sept piliers suivants, dont 6 piliers technologiques et un pilier transverse.
11

1. Développer et diffuser l’usage des simulateurs
et accélérateurs NISQ [352 M€]
Enjeux
Depuis quelques années, les simulateurs et calculateurs « NISQ » (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum)
exploitables commercialement sont devenues une réalité en attendant l’ordinateur quantique « LSQ »
(Large Scale Quantum) capable de passer à l’échelle. Ces machines constituent, dès aujourd’hui, des
outils d’apprentissage du calcul quantique. Des écosystèmes très fortement intégrés se constituent, dès
aujourd’hui, autour de machines qui, bien qu’elles ne confèrent pas d’avantage quantique avéré, per-
mettent d’anticiper les ruptures tout en fédérant et fidélisant un écosystème de développeurs autour
d’outils de développements Hardware-dépendants.
Domaine d’action
En s’appuyant sur GENCI (Grand Equipement National de Calcul Intensif), chargé de l’équipement des
centres nationaux de calcul intensif, et le CEA, concepteur et exploitant du TGCC (Très Grand Centre
de Calcul), principal centre de calcul public français, la France hébergera la première infrastructure au
monde d’ordinateurs quantiques hybrides, intégrant d’un point de vue logiciel et matériel des accéléra-
teurs quantiques à un système de supercalculateurs classiques. La mise en place de cette infrastructure
de rang mondial, intégrant différents émulateurs et ordinateurs quantiques basés sur des principes tech-
nologiques divers, représentera un levier d’action fort permettant de :
 Minimiser le risque de dépendance à une seule option technologique ;
 Développer l’écosystème logiciel, les applications et les usages ;
 Développer la légitimité et le rayonnement de la France à l’international.
Au moment opportun, l’industrialisation des accélérateurs quantiques sera notamment soutenue par le
déploiement de lignes pilotes permettant d’affiner les procédés industriels en environnement représen-
tatif de la production, tout en réduisant les risques et le temps de cycle de transfert à l’industrie.
14
2. Développer l’Ordinateur Quantique Passant
à l’Echelle LSQ [432 M€]
Enjeux
Le développement d’ordinateurs quantiques capables de passer à l’échelle ou « LSQ » (Large Scale
Quantum) vise à rendre possible des calculs et modélisations d’une complexité supérieure de plusieurs
ordres de grandeur à ce qui peut être traité avec les supercalculateurs traditionnels, même accélérés
avec de des qubits NISQ. A partir de quelques centaines/milliers de qubits tolérants aux défauts (qubits
logiques), l’usage de ces machines permettra d’accélérer considérablement l’innovation et la mise sur
le marché de produits issus des secteurs industriels qui reposent sur de longues phases de validation.
La France est considérée comme l’un des rares pays capables de relever ce défi, grâce à l’excellence
de son historique en recherche amont et technologique, et à son industrie micro-électronique ; c’est
également le défi qui comporte le plus d’incertitudes sur le calendrier et de risques compte-tenu du
faible niveau de maturité et de la complexité des technologies en cours d’exploration.
Domaine d’action
S’agissant des composants technologiques, les actions auront vocation à explorer, dérisquer et hybrider
différentes solutions de conception et de fabrication de qubits robustes et de portes logiques perfor-
mantes compatibles avec l’industrie microélectronique, puis sélectionner les candidats les plus promet-
teurs pour un passage à l’échelle, parmi les qubits de spin sur Silicium, les transmons sur Silicium,
Silicium/Germanium, cat-qubits, qubits topologiques, qubits photoniques, flying qubits, etc.
Le développement de ces différentes voies d’architectures matérielles devra se tenir dans l’esprit d’un
continuum entre le NISQ et le LSQ tout en mettant l’accent sur l’hybridation des plateformes technolo-
giques compatibles avec une industrialisation, en termes de passage à l’échelle et de qualité de fabri-
cation. Ces voies seront menées de front en s’enrichissant les unes les autres, le tout dans une ap-
proche globale pluridisciplinaire.
En matière d’architecture système, une action de soutien à l’Innovation visera à développer une mi-
croarchitecture de calcul et une électronique de pilotage, qui puissent contrôler et corriger les erreurs
de diverses technologies de qubits passant à l’échelle.
Sur le plan algorithmique, l’action aura vocation à développer des algorithmes robustes au bruit et pou-
vant tirer pleinement profit d’un ordinateur quantique passant à l’échelle pour aborder les problèmes les
plus complexes: repliement de protéines, séquestration du CO , production de catalyseurs bio-inspirés
2
etc.
15
3. Développer les technologies et applications
des Capteurs Quantiques [258 M€]
Enjeux
Les capteurs quantiques figurent parmi les technologies quantiques historiquement soutenues par l’Etat
via son soutien aux recherches amont, dont les plus matures ouvrent vers différentes applications pro-
metteuses : navigation, prospection géologique, observation de la terre, interception, détection, sismo-
graphie, magnétométrie, science des matériaux, etc. Néanmoins, la complexité de leur mise en œuvre
et l’environnement extrême souvent nécessaire à leur fonctionnement limitent aujourd’hui les débou-
chés à des marchés très spécifiques, ce qui compromet la viabilité industrielle à long terme. Il est né-
cessaire d’accompagner l’incrémentation en maturité de ces technologies vers les applications et les
marchés, tout en favorisant leur intégration dans les systèmes qui pourraient en bénéficier, afin de dé-
velopper un marché civil, source de viabilité économique.
Domaine d’action
En matière de capteurs à atomes froids, les actions auront vocation à consolider la position de la France
sur ces technologies et développer la prochaine génération de senseurs inertiels, de capteurs magné-
tiques et d’horloges atomiques. Pour les technologies les plus matures (atomes de Rydberg, supracon-
ducteurs, impuretés dans le diamant, etc.), l’action aura pour objectif de soutenir l’intégration des
briques élémentaires dans leur environnement système, notamment en améliorant leurs caractéris-
tiques face aux contraintes d’embarcabilité, tout en répondant aux objectifs de souveraineté et de réap-
propriation des chaines de valeurs en matière de capteurs.
Afin de maximiser la « surface marché » et renforcer la viabilité économique de ces technologies à plus
long terme, une vague de « Challenges » visera, en 2022, à permettre l’identification de nouveaux mar-
chés civils pour prendre le relai du marché de la défense : nano-IRM, contrôle industriel en milieu hostile,
analyse de terrain, analyse moléculaire pour la chimie et la biologie, étude des matériaux sous haute
pression pour le stockage de l’énergie, etc.
16
4. Développer l’offre de Cryptographie
Post-Quantique [156 M€]
Enjeux
Dans « l’ère de l’ordinateur quantique » capable de déchiffrer, éventuellement rétroactivement, des don-
nées protégées par des algorithmes à clé publique actuels, les agences de sécurité recommandent de
garantir la confidentialité et l’intégrité des systèmes d’informations et des communications de l’État dès
aujourd’hui. Si la nécessité de développer et utiliser des algorithmes post-quantiques, c’est-à-dire résis-
tant à une cryptanalyse quantique, fait maintenant consensus, il reste à définir ces algorithmes. Il existe
plusieurs familles d’algorithmes de cryptographie post-quantique et divers problèmes mathématiques et
variantes sont utilisés pour bâtir la sécurité de ces schémas. Cependant, pour la plupart d’entre eux, il
n’y a pas encore de consensus international sur le niveau de confiance que l’on peut avoir dans leur sé-
curité.
Domaine d’action
Afin d’organiser la migration progressive vers la cryptographie post-quantique et de maîtriser les implé-
mentations matérielles garantissant performances et sécurité, la stratégie quantique portera des travaux
dans les domaines du développement algorithmique, de l’implémentation matérielle et de la validation
expérimentale.
La transition vers les algorithmes post-quantiques ne se fera pas d’une manière brutale. Une période
transitoire sera nécessaire, où les algorithmes post-quantiques cohabiteront avec les mécanismes ac-
tuels afin de se rassurer que les algorithmes post-quantiques n’introduisent pas de régressions par
rapport à l’existant. Les algorithmes candidats à la standardisation étant plus consommateurs de res-
sources que leurs analogues classiques, une action aura vocation à explorer les possibilités d’implé-
menter ces nouveaux algorithmes dans des dispositifs matériels spécialisé à ressources limitées. Enfin,
certains capteurs quantiques seront explorés à l’aune de ce domaine applicatif, car ils pourraient offrir
à relativement court terme de nouvelles capacités de cryptanalyse et de caractérisation d’attaques phy-
siques sur les équipements de cybersécurité.
17
5. Développer les systèmes de communications
quantiques [325 M€]
Enjeux
En permettant la distribution d’états intriqués, les communications quantiques peuvent avoir plusieurs
applications prometteuses inaccessibles avec les technologies actuelles : interférométrie à longue dis-
tance, référence de temps pour la synchronisation d’horloges atomiques, mise en réseau d’ordinateurs
quantiques, distribution quantique de clés, etc. La mise en réseau de capteurs quantiques pour l’inter-
férométrie à très longue distance et la distribution de temps ultra précise intéressera, par exemple, à la
fois les scientifiques, les financiers, les fournisseurs d’énergie, etc. L’accès distant aux ordinateurs
quantiques et le partage de calcul entre plusieurs ordinateurs quantiques permet d’associer plusieurs
processeurs afin d’accroître leurs capacités de façon exponentielle, ainsi que de permettre de localiser
ces machines dans des centres de calculs distants des utilisateurs.
L’Europe et la France en particulier ont été précurseurs sur ces technologies. En soutenant la recherche
et l’innovation dans ce domaine, la France conservera son leadership scientifique, notamment pour
accroitre son autonomie vis-à-vis de dispositifs quantiques non maitrisés en Europe.
Domaine d’action
L’utilisation pratique des communications quantiques reposera sur la capacité à développer des com-
posants photoniques quantiques pouvant s’intégrer dans les infrastructures de communications exis-
tantes sans nécessiter de déploiements spécifiques, ce qui constituera un axe majeur pour orienter les
activités dans ce domaine. En outre, elles aboutiront à l’expérimentation et à l’évaluation du déploiement
de composants photoniques quantiques dans des prototypes de réseaux de communication fibrée exis-
tants, mettant l’accent sur les aspects qui relèvent du triptyque débit, distance des liens établis, et cri-
tères de sécurité. En s’appuyant sur deux réseaux de communications fibrés expérimentaux, l’un dans
la région de Nice, l’autre en Ile de France, les nouveaux composants et protocoles de communications
seront testés et optimisés en conditions réelles. Par ailleurs, la France continuera à s’inscrire dans les
travaux européens portés dans EuroQCI.
Sur le plan algorithmique, l’action aura vocation à développer de nouveaux protocoles de communica-
tions pour le calcul quantique distribué, le calcul quantique aveugle ou « Blind Quantum Computing »,
les protocoles d’interférométrie longue distance pour l’observation de la terre et de l’espace, la distribu-
tion d’horloge atomiques, ainsi qu’à imaginer les futures applications des communications quantiques.
En revanche, en raison de leur relative jeunesse, les communications quantiques n’ont pas été intensi-
vement évaluées sur le plan de la cybersécurité, contrairement aux communications classiques. Sur ce
plan, si théoriquement les communications quantiques sont invulnérables aux attaques sur la base des
lois de la physique, les réalisations pratiques introduisent des vulnérabilités potentiellement exploitables
par un attaquant. Afin de renforcer la résilience des dispositifs de communications quantiques aux at-
taques physiques, une action sera dédiée à l’identification et la correction des vulnérabilités des sys-
tèmes de communications quantiques.
18
6. Développer une offre de technologies
habilitantes compétitive [292 M€]
Enjeux
La cryogénie, les lasers et l’électro-
nique bas bruit sont des technologies
habilitantes stratégiques pour les tech-
nologies quantiques ainsi que pour
d’autres domaines (fusion nucléaire,
astronomie, etc.), ce qui requiert de
soutenir et développer notre autono-
mie sur le court terme, en faisant
émerger une offre française
compétitive et sécuriser les
approvisionnements nationaux.
Promouvoir la maîtrise par les acteurs
industriels français de ces technolo-
gies à très court terme ouvre des dé-
bouchés intéressants à l’export, en
plus des technologies quantiques, dans les grands instruments scientifiques, les dispositifs médicaux,
et l’électronique spatiale, dans un contexte international marqué par une polarisation autour d’un
nombre limité d’acteurs. A long terme, la maîtrise de ces technologies pourrait permettre aux acteurs
industriels français de devenir des fournisseurs de premier plan dans plusieurs secteurs.
Domaine d’action
Le besoin d’augmenter progressivement le nombre de qubits par processeur quantique exacerbe la
contrainte d’opérer dans un environnement cryogénique extrême, qui ne réside pas dans l’atteinte de
températures sub-Kelvin mais dans la puissance nécessaire pour refroidir de grands volumes compre-
nant les qubits, le câblage et l’électronique placée dans les étages intermédiaires. Les actions seront
focalisées sur la recherche d’un point d’équilibre optimal entre la tolérance en température des qubits
et la performance des technologies cryogéniques industrielles, qui est un prérequis pour envisager le
passage des ordinateurs quantiques à l’échelle.
Par ailleurs, le développement de nouveaux lasers pour le refroidissement et la manipulation d’atomes
bénéficiera d’un soutien qui aura vocation à améliorer fiabilité, rendements, puissance, agilité spectrale
et stabilité des lasers existants, ainsi qu’à développer de nouveaux lasers capables de manipuler une
nouvelle classe d’atomes aux propriétés quantiques prometteuses pour le calcul et les capteurs.
Enfin, pour favoriser l’embarcabilité et la tenue en environnement des composants au niveau système,
les actions permettront d’appréhender les problématiques d’intérêt telle que la miniaturisation, le dur-
cissement, afin de rendre les dispositifs compatibles avec les conditions d’emploi. En complément, des
travaux seront également attendus sur les processus particuliers de maintien en condition opération-
nelle que ces technologies spécifiques pourraient nécessiter.
19
7. Structurer transversalement l’écosystème
Enjeux
Pour soutenir et convertir en avantage concurrentiel pérenne les travaux scientifiques et techniques, il
est essentiel de développer les compétences et le capital humain via la formation initiale et continue, le
renforcement des infrastructures technologiques, de créer un environnement favorable à l’intensification
de l’entrepreneuriat, au transfert de technologie, promouvant l’attractivité vis-à-vis des acteurs interna-
tionaux et des meilleurs talents mondiaux.
Domaines d’action
Développer les compétences et le capital humain
La stratégie devra permettre de créer 16 000 emplois directs et indirects à l’horizon 2030. Cette montée
en puissance devra s’appuyer sur différents niveaux de formation, combinant formation initiale et for-
mation continue, formation technique, d’ingénierie et formation par la recherche. Les équipes de déve-
loppement industriel en hardware et software quantique pourront s’appuyer sur des experts dont la
formation initiale sera centrée sur les technologies quantiques. Ces experts pourront encadrer des col-
laborateurs formés par un ambitieux programme de formation continue. La formation quantique initiale
sera renforcée dans les écoles d’ingénieurs et dans les masters à travers des programmes interdisci-
plinaires alliant physique quantique, algorithmique quantique et ingénierie. Enfin, des modules de for-
mation aux technologies quantiques seront introduits au niveau DUT, afin de former un nombre suffisant
de techniciens capables de participer au développement industriel des technologies quantiques et de
leurs technologies habilitantes.
Renforcer les infrastructures technologiques
Plateformes de fabrication : la qualité des moyens d’élaboration des matériaux sont essentiels pour
obtenir des performances au meilleur niveau. En l’absence, les filières stratégiques seraient dépen-
dantes de fourniture de services par des infrastructures étrangères. Les actions viseront donc à donner
les moyens de se mettre au meilleur niveau international, notamment pour l’élaboration de nanomaté-
riaux fonctionnels.
Plateforme de métrologie quantique : la métrologie joue un rôle essentiel dans l’industrialisation des
technologies émergentes, au travers de la mesure fiable des performances. Elle permet la validation
des technologies dont les performances sont supérieures aux technologies existantes, et ainsi leur
adoption par l’industrie et le marché. Pour préserver sa compétitivité dans le domaine, assurer sa ca-
pacité à soutenir l’émergence de ses propres filières industrielles quantiques, et fournir à son industrie
une traçabilité vis-à-vis du Système International d’Unités, la France se dotera d’une plateforme de
métrologie quantique qui rassemblera les compétences et les installations de mesure du Réseau Na-
tional de Métrologie.
Renforcer l’entrepreneuriat et le transfert de technologie
Sur le plan entrepreneurial, les technologies quantiques font face, comme d’autre domaines « à risque »,
à la difficulté d’accéder à du capital-risque de qualité auprès des fonds généralistes. Dans le cadre de
la stratégie, deux fonds impliquant des sociétés de gestion à forte compétence quantique pourront venir
compléter l’action du premier fonds dédié au domaine en France (Quantonation) et pourront être sou-
tenus par l’Etat en fonds de fonds. Enfin, le fonds French Tech Souveraineté complètera le dispositif
pour apporter le soutien nécessaire afin de protéger le capital des sociétés stratégiques.
Sur le plan du transfert de technologie, la stratégie accompagnera des initiatives de type « hub » qui
auront vocation à densifier le maillage des relations entre acteurs industriels, startups et académiques,
pour accompagner les projets entrepreneuriaux et établir des passerelles avec l’international.
20
Opportunités de coopération internationales
Par effet de levier, l’action de l’État permettra de mobiliser plus de 200 M€ de l’Europe, dont une partie
via des co-financements paritaires de la Commission, abondés en contrepartie des financements natio-
naux. Un consortium est déjà sur les rails, cofinancé par l’entreprise commune EuroHPC, regroupant la
France, l’Allemagne, l’Italie, l’Espagne, l’Irlande et l’Autriche, pour développer le premier prototype d’or-
dinateur hybride intégrant un accélérateur quantique d’au moins 100 qubits à l’horizon 2023, sur le site
du Très Grand Centre de Calcul à Bruyères-Le-Chatel. Cette plateforme Hardware et logicielle consti-
tuera la première étape vers un ‘hub quantique européen’, qui portera les travaux des communautés
d’utilisateurs scientifiques et industriels, en vue de développer les cas d’usage exploitant pleinement
ces nouvelles capacités de calcul.
Cet élan sera relayé par un Grand Défi NISQ, un programme public-privé qui pourrait donner lieu à un
élargissement de la dynamique collaborative avec l’Allemagne. L’objet de ce Grand Défi est de créer
les conditions pour utiliser cette plateforme hybride comme une infrastructure commune ‘bac à sable’
pour les technologies quantiques, tant matérielles que logicielles, notamment pour mener un benchmark
des performances en fonction de la nature de l’accélérateur quantique intégré (atomes froids, jonctions
supraconductrices,…), avec la finalité d’explorer l’étendue des capacités qu’offrent les machines hy-
brides en termes d’applications. In fine, elle aura vocation à :
 tirer le plus grand bénéfice des accélérateurs quantiques existants en les intégrant dans le con-
texte plus global du calcul haute performance et en développant des solutions algorithmiques
hybrides quantique-classique ;
 diffuser l’usage du calcul quantique dans les secteurs prioritaires en développant des solutions
logicielles et des environnements de développement hardware-agnostiques sur la base de lan-
gages de programmations et librairies dédiés aux secteurs différents applicatifs.
Il convient également de noter que la thématique du calcul quantique est en cours d’intensification dans
le cadre des efforts que la Commission Européenne engage dans le domaine du calcul intensif, notam-
ment via l’Entreprise Commune EuroHPC. La thématique des communications quantiques sera quant
à elle portée au niveau européen par le groupement EuroQCI, qui est actuellement en cours de consti-
tution sous l’égide de la Commission.
Par ailleurs, la France sera force de proposition pour intensifier les dynamiques historiques conjointes
en matière de recherche avec les grandes nations des technologies quantiques en Europe (Pays-Bas,
Angleterre,…), en explorant toutes les opportunités de collaborations avec l’ambition de repositionner
le centre de gravité mondial des technologies quantiques vers l’Europe.
21
Mise en œuvre
L’exécution nécessitera un financement de l’Etat cumulé d’environ 1 Md€ sur quatre ans. Cette action
de l’État sera complétée par les financements européens, et par le co-financement des industriels, dont
l’implication sera déterminante pour le succès de cette stratégie, afin de renforcer leur activité en R&D,
conquérir de nouveaux marchés ou relocaliser des activités en France.
En soutien à l’entreprenariat, les investisseurs institutionnels et les fonds de confiance se mobiliseront
pour soutenir l’écosystème d’innovation naissant dans le domaine et pour faire émerger de nouveaux
champions industriels nationaux.
L’ensemble permet d’aboutir à un engagement global public-privé de 1,8 Mds€.
Cet engagement est à la hauteur des enjeux et de l’ambition de s’affirmer durablement comme un leader
du domaine, avec l’objectif de création de 16 000 emplois directs à l’horizon 2030, en faveur d’une
activité qui représentera à terme entre 1 et 2 % des exportations françaises.
Le développement des compétences passe par la formation initiale et continue, soit près de 5000 nou-
veaux talents formés aux technologies quantiques d’ici 2025, chercheurs, ingénieurs, techniciens, avec
de nouveaux cursus universitaires ouverts dès la rentrée prochaine.
La création d’un environnement favorable à l’intensification de l’entrepreneuriat et au transfert de tech-
nologie, contribuera à développer notre patrimoine intellectuel et industriel, tout en cultivant le rayonne-
ment vis-à-vis des acteurs internationaux du domaine, afin d’attirer l’investissement ainsi que les meil-
leurs talents mondiaux. En particulier, le soutien à l’émergence et à la croissance des start-ups se fera
notamment au travers de la mobilisation de fonds propres, avec l’ambition d’atteindre un montant total
public-privé de 310 M€.
Un effort important sera consacré à la recherche, notamment via un Programme et Equipements Prio-
ritaires de Recherche (PEPR) doté d’un montant total de 150 M€, autour de quatre thèmes structurants
: qubits robustes « solid state », atomes froids, algorithmes quantiques, frontières de la calculabilité et
de la sécurité.
La maturation, l’innovation et le transfert technologique, feront l’objet d’un soutien sans précédent selon
une variété de modalités telles que les Grands défis d’Innovation, les programmes de maturation tech-
nologique ou de soutien au déploiement industriel, dont le cumul atteint 350M€, avec un effet d’entrai-
nement multiplicateur attendu de l’investissement industriel.
Enfin, l’exécution de la stratégie sera portée par un coordinateur interministériel, qui en pilotera
l’implémentation sous la responsabilité du Conseil interministériel de l’innovation, avec le souci
constant de maximiser l’impact industriel, l’emploi et la création de valeur économique pérenne.

Les faits marquants dans l’écosystème
quantique national, ces 6 derniers mois
 Juin 2020 : « Qubit Pharmaceuticals », une start-up française spin-off de la recherche (CNAM,
CNRS, Sorbonne, University of Texas at Austin, Washington University), vient de clore un tour
de pré-amorçage grâce à l’aide de Quantonation. Cette start-up porte une révolution dans le
domaine des logiciels de simulation avancée pour le développement de médicaments, grâce à
la prise en compte des effets quantiques dans la dynamique moléculaire. Aujourd’hui opérées
et peaufinées sur des supercalculateurs, les solutions logicielles seront prêtes pour engendrer
des ruptures radicales dès lors qu’elles tourneront sur les premiers ordinateurs quantiques.
 Juillet 2020 : La start-up Quandela, qui développe des sources mono-photon aux propriétés
très attendues pour les ordinateurs quantiques optiques et les réseaux de communication, a
clôturé sa levée de fonds d’amorçage à 1,5 M€, emmenée par Quantonation et suivie par
French Tech Seed de Bpifrance.
 Eté 2020 : Atos a amélioré son simulateur quantique commercial QLM avec une nouvelle ar-
chitecture hardware, qui devient QLM E(nhanced), le simulateur quantique le plus performant
au monde offrant jusqu’à 12 fois plus de puissance de calcul que son prédécesseur.
Atos QLM E offre de nouvelles opportunités en matière de simulation pour les futurs ordinateurs
quantiques NISQ, dont la commercialisation est prévue dans les prochaines années.
 Septembre 2020 : la startup Quandela lance Prometheus, sa nouvelle génération de générateur
de photons indistingables exploitables dans le calcul et la cryptographie quantiques.
 Septembre 2020 : Air Liquide a acquis la PME française Cryoconcept, spécialisée dans la réfri-
gération à dilution, une technologie permettant d’atteindre de très basses températures. Ce
mouvement marque l’engagement d’Air Liquide dans le domaine de la cryogénie extrême,
proche du zéro absolu, qui constitue une technologie habilitante cruciale pour les technologies
quantiques.
 Octobre 2020 : Thales développe des capteurs à puces atomiques, avec l’objectif de réaliser à
terme une centrale inertielle complète (combinant des accéléromètres, une horloge et un gyro-
mètre tri-axes) basée sur des atomes froids miniature et substantiellement plus performante
que les technologies actuelles. Une des fonctionnalités clés a été démontrée, permettant la
manipulation des nuages atomiques sur puce, à l’aide de courants radiofréquences.
 Novembre 2020 : Atos annonce un partenariat avec Pasqal pour développer un accélérateur
quantique reposant sur la technologie des atomes neutres, destiné à équiper des systèmes de
calcul haute performance. Cette technologie permettrait de renforcer les capacités de calcul
des ordinateurs actuels et ainsi développer des systèmes hybrides quantique-HPC exploitables
à court terme.
 Décembre 2020 : le consortium Européen HPCQS, construit autour de l’axe franco-allemand
GENCI/Centre de Recherche de Jülich, a été sélectionné par EuroHPC pour réaliser en 2023
le premier ordinateur européen intégrant un accélérateur quantique d’au moins 100 qubits. Ce
consortium regroupe les grands organismes français de recherche (CNRS, CEA, INRIA), ainsi
qu’Atos et la start-up Pasqal, qui livreront respectivement le supercalculateur et l’accélérateur
quantique qui lui sera intégré. Les travaux démarrent dès le premier semestre 2021.

 Décembre 2020 : Thales développe une antenne quantique supraconductrice basée sur l’utili-
sation de réseaux de SQUIDs (Superconductor Quantum Interference Devices) capable de dé-
tecter un large spectre de fréquences. La détection de signaux radiofréquences a été démon-
trée jusqu’à 100 MHz avec une antenne quantique de 1cm, alors que la taille d’une antenne
classique est de 1,5m.
 Décembre 2020, Atos a dévoilé le « Q Score », la première métrique universelle qui rend pos-
sible l’objectivation de la performance des ordinateurs quantiques et la ‘suprématie quantique’.
 Décembre 2020 : le CEA Leti échantillonne ses qubits à spins d’électron qui améliore le contrôle
des qubits.
 Décembre 2020 : Pasqal et l’équipe d’Antoine Browaeys d’IOGS publient plusieurs papiers
avec un record de simulation quantique avec 196 qubits à base d’atomes froids.

Prochains appels à projets /
1er semestre 2021
 Programme et Equipements Prioritaire de Recherche (PEPR), pour soutenir l’effort de
recherche de la communauté scientifique, doté de 150 M€ autour de quatre thèmes: qubits
robustes « solid state », atomes froids, algorithmes quantiques, frontières de la calculabilité et
de la sécurité (premier trimestre 2021) ;
 Grand Défi sur le développement d'accélérateurs quantiques de première génération
(NISQ), ou ordinateur quantique ‘imparfait’, pour préparer en 2022, une action d’innovation sur
le développement de l'ordinateur quantique capable de passer à l'échelle (LSQ) , ou ordinateur
quantique ‘parfait’ (au plus tard fin du premier semestre 2021) ;
 Programme de Développement Industriel relatif aux technologies capacitantes, à l’image
du Si28, de la cryogénie et des lasers ; ce programme permet d’accompagner les activités de
recherche et développement collaboratives public-privé à maturité technologique intermédiaire
(TRL3-6), proche du marché mais au risque technologique non supportable par les acteurs
privés seuls (à partir du premier trimestre 2021) ;
 Programme de Maturation Technologique, pour encourager les activités de recherche et dé-
veloppement collaboratives public-privé à maturité intermédiaire avec des perspectives de mar-
ché à moyen terme, concernant l’intégration des capteurs, les protocoles et corrections d’erreur,
ainsi que l’algorithmique post-quantique (au plus tard fin du premier semestre 2021).

1. Exploiting the potential of quantum
technologies for Germany
New technologies have a huge impact on our everyday lives: they form the basis for a wide range of possibilities
within the digital world, the foundation for the effective generation of energy, new forms of mobility and innovative
medical technology. For a future-proof and technologically sovereign Germany, it is crucial to identify upcoming
technologies and their potential as early as possible, to create excellent framework conditions for their future design
and use, and to actively shape technology leaps. Quantum technologies are a future technology that have the po-
tential to disrupt and offer particularly promising prospects for use. Although they are still at a comparatively early
development stage, innovative uses within the economy and society are already emerging, which also address the
challenges noted above.

the various key technologies involved in quantum
technologies are different:1 with regard to enabling
technologies and core components for quantum

have also reached market maturity. In contrast,
quantum computing is only expected to be widely
used in the medium to long term, although it does
offer enormous development potential.2, 3 Like any
other new technology, quantum technologies not only
provide opportunities but also challenges, and it is
important to keep track of them. For example, quan-
tum computers will be powerful enough in the long
term to threaten the security of traditional digital
communications with the cryptography that is used
today. The migration to cryptographic procedures

2. Huge challenges,
extraordinary potential
Quantum technologies, i.e., the targeted control of quantum mechanical effects and their technological exploita-
tion, promise enormous progress for applications in the economy, society and governmental institutions. Depending
on the type of technology (quantum computing and quantum simulation, quantum communication and post-
quantum cryptography, quantum sensor technology and quantum metrology, as well as the associated enabling
technologies), the application maturity and its possible uses vary.
9 QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME
Quantum computing and
quantum simulation
The enormous potential is most evident in quantum
computing. Traditional computers will reach their
limits in the long term, for example, in the simula-
tion of chemical reactions and compounds (material
sciences, drug design) or the optimisation of complex
systems, such as logistical systems. Through new
algorithms based on qubits (quantum bits) instead of
traditional bits, a quantum computer could deliver
clear advantages in this respect. There is also poten-
tial, for example, in forecasting weather services and
the modelling of climate change and its consequences.
Research has therefore been undertaken into a pleth-
ora of technologically different implementations of
quantum computers (see also ‘Quantum computing’

make important contributions to hyper-connected,

TOP-LEVEL TECHNOLOGY FOR CREATIVE POWER AND TECHNOLOGICAL SOVEREIGNTY 22
Security and sovereignty
The expected changes brought about by quantum
technologies are likely to have profound consequences
in the area of digitalisation and (information) security.
This concerns, for example, aspects of communi-
cation, cryptography and elements of sensor tech-
nologies. There are therefore increasingly stringent
security requirements on both an international and
national level.
Germany must master these technologies of the
future in order to be able to act with sovereignty.
Against this background, the Federal Government
will create the conditions to ensure data security for
business and public administration, security author-
ities and the Bundeswehr (Federal Armed Forces) by
using post-quantum cryptography and complementa-

For this purpose, the Federal Government will

on quantum mechanical principles, for example,
∙ promote the development of quantum-resistant quantum effect-based security tokens,

independent qualification of components is also an
important prerequisite for stable value chains and
therefore for tapping economic potential. Further-
more, an infrastructure such as this helps to build
trust in quantum technologies and prevents over-
blown expectations.
Standardisation requires the companies involved to
interact on an equal footing, to expect significant eco-
nomic benefits from the results and to have sufficient
financial and human resources to carry out intensive
committee work. The influence of a particular eco-
nomic area in the international standardisation bod-
ies basically depends on the number and influence of
such companies as these. Against this background the
Federal Government, in cooperation with its Europe-
an partners, will work towards greater German and
European involvement in the standardisation bodies.
By promoting an entrepreneurial ecosystem for quan-

manner. The need for standards that have already

25 QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK PROGRAMME
Today, cutting-edge technology is organised into
global value chains. In technically demanding areas
that require high levels of investment, the available
economic resources can be a limiting factor that
makes international cooperation necessary. At the
same time the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian
war of aggression in Ukraine have highlighted how
fragile and vulnerable global supply chains can be and
how the value of global technological sovereignty in
an uncertain world has changed. The Federal Govern-
ment will therefore support technology development
in quantum computing in the long term. On the basis
of the roadmap drawn up by an independent council
of experts, the Federal Government is implement-
ing an ambitious package of measures as part of the
fiscal stimulus and future package, the aim of which
is to achieve technological sovereignty for Germany
and Europe in the field of quantum computing. This

work of research projects, there is public funding
for the development of hardware components as
well as their design and implementation in demon-
stration set-ups based on the various technology
platforms.
∙ In parallel the industrialisation of technically
more mature technologies is taking place within
the framework of contracts, in particular through
DLR’s quantum computing initiative.
∙ Establishment of a network for quantum al-
gorithms and software. Here, the focus is on
industry-specific applications that address opti-
misation problems and procedures that look in
particular at searches within large data pools.
∙ Development of enabling technologies: in addition

The success of the conceptual framework programme is measured by milestones, which at research policy level
serve as target achievement control. They are regularly reviewed and, if necessary, adapted to the dynamic devel-
opment of the international research field. By the end of the conceptual framework programme’s term in 2026,
the following milestones should have been reached in Germany, depending on the technology level:

The goal is for Germany to catch up in technological
terms with the leading players in quantum computing
outside the EU. This is primarily about competitive-
ness in a purely technical sense, such as the availa-

The MPG sees its contribution to the national strategy
primarily within the context of the continuation and
expansion of excellent fundamental research. This
also includes opening up new subject areas, paying
attention to the patenting of new ideas, promoting
spin-off companies and start-ups, and participating
in national and international research networks. The
MPG makes essential contributions to the transfer
of fundamental phenomena of the second quantum
revolution into application-relevant technologies.
For example, the MPG played a key role in the expert
council that identified the central challenges in the
field of quantum computing and issued recommen-
aspects of this topic. With the fundamental research dations for future action in the form of a national

Korea's New Quantum Jump
into the Future
“Quantum Jump,” a quantum mechanical term, refers to the phenomenon where anelectron in a lower-
energy atomic orbit around the nucleus makes a sudden transition to a higher-energy atomic orbit, resulting
in an abrupt increase in energy levels, much like ascending a staircase, when the atom absorbs energy. This
phenomenon, resembling teleportation, is increasingly used as a metaphor for swift innovation and progress
over a short time span.
Since its inception, Korea, supported by exceptional national capabilities, foresight, world-leading science and
technology, and industries, has achieved unprecedented success unmatched in global history. It stands as the
only country to have transitioned from a developing nation into an advanced economy. Now, with the dawn of
the quantum era, it is poised for yet another quantum jump.
Science and technology stand as the most potent forces propelling human civilization into entirely new
dimensions. Among these forces, quantum science and technology, while not widely known to the general
public, have profoundly impacted various aspects of human life. From smartphones, laptops, and electronic
devices that dominate our daily routines to chemical substances, life sciences, medical technology, lasers,
and remote communications, our understanding of the atomic micro-world underpins almost every advanced
civilization of the 21st century. In our contemporary world, quantum science and technology have become so
indispensable that even the smallest progress seems unattainable without them.
What is even more inspiring to witness is that the quantum revolution, with the potential to address the world's
challenges in the 21st century and shape a new human civilization, is only in its early stages. The journey has
just begun, from fundamental research shedding light on the origins of life and the universe to combatting
climate change, ensuring human safety, overcoming incurable diseases, extending the human lifespan,
uncovering new energy sources, and exploring uncharted territories of the universe. Humanity nurtures great
expectations for every conceivable scientific and technological innovation.
The pursuit of innovation in quantum science and technology not only offers Korea a new engine for future
growth but also contributes to the global community's prosperity, consequently elevating the nation's status
and dignity to unprecedented levels.

Fundamentals of Quantum Science
and Technology
What is Quantum?
Quantum is a broad term encompassing physical phenomena that involve the discrete nature of
physical quantities, including energy and momentum. Quantum objects demonstrate characteristics
of both particle discreteness and wave superposition.

Korea's National Quantum Strategy
Korea is Focusing on

Quantum Science and Technology
It has been over 120 years since the concept of quantum emerged, and almost 100 years since the inception
of modern quantum physics. The period encompassing the 20th century and the early 21st century, in which
semiconductor technology based on quantum physics brought about a revolutionary transformation in human
civilization, is known as the era of the “First Quantum Revolution.”
The Advent of the Second Quantum Revolution
The forthcoming era of the “Second Quantum Revolution” will harness advanced quantum phenomena
such as superposition and entanglement to a greater extent. Beyond the traditional binary representation
of bits, which signify either 0 or 1, a novel information unit called a qubit, capable of exploiting the property
of superposition to simultaneously hold both 0 and 1 values, will play a pivotal role. Quantum computers,
showcasing unprecedented computational power achieved through qubit interconnection, will be extensively
employed in the advancement of artificial intelligence, acceleration of drug discovery and material research,
transformation of energy solutions, space exploration, and resolution of complex mathematical problems.
The emergence of quantum computers also signifies the collapse of traditional encryption systems based
on integer factorization that could not be cracked by classical digital computers. Consequently, countries
around the world are striving to develop groundbreaking quantum cryptography and network technologies
that leverage quantum phenomena such as superposition, entanglement, and observation-induced changes
in information to significantly enhance security. Furthermore, there is a burgeoning technological competition
to apply quantum sensor technology, which surpasses the fundamental limitations of conventional sensors
in terms of precision and sensitivity, to advanced industries that require high detection capabilities, including
national defense and other cutting-edge sectors.

NATIONAL AGENDA FOR
QUANTUM TECHNOLOGY
September 2019
Foreword
My name is Robbert Dijkgraaf. I'm a big fan of both science and the Netherlands, which
this National Agenda for Quantum Technology brings together in an exciting way.
I often say that the future is already here: it's in our labs and in the heads of our scientists
and engineers. And quantum technology is a key part of that future. As well as providing
the basis for developing fantastic new devices and industries, quantum technology can
enable us to resolve the big problems facing our society, such as climate change, health
care and security.
All over the world people are investing in quantum technology, but here in the
Netherlands we're privileged to host a number of fantastic initiatives. Outstanding,
world-leading research institutes such as QuTech in Delft, QuSoft in Amsterdam
and QT/e in Eindhoven, excellent research groups in Leiden, Nijmegen, Groningen,
Twente and Utrecht, coordinating bodies such as TNO and StartupDelta, and a range
of exciting industrial partnerships and startups.
Now is the time for putting all those pieces together, for taking up the gauntlet and
for investing in new talent, new researchers, new infrastructure and industry – in
other words, in the entire ecosystem. This document sets the agenda for working on
breakthroughs in research and innovation, on the development of new applications and
3
markets, on the competences required in fields such as systems engineering, and on the
ethical, legal and social aspects of quantum technology. If we action that agenda, by
2030 we'll have a cool, exciting and new science, plus a new industry, and maybe new
solutions for building a better world as well.
I therefore hope that you'll enjoy reading this National Agenda for Quantum Technology,
and that you'll give it your support. Because we're going to need help realizing the initiatives
and activities described, and help creating the envisaged Dutch Quantum Delta, QΔNL!

This is a white cat in a state of superposition: its state is simultaneously 'dead' and 'alive'.
(The plus sign (+) indicates a state of superposition; the brackets ([ >) indicate the individual
simultaneous states, known as 'eigenstates'.) As soon as you look at the cat (perform a
measurement), you observe that it is either dead or alive: the superposition 'collapses'
to leave a single eigenstate.

Here we have two cats: one white and one black. Each is separately in a state of superposition,
being both dead and alive. If you look at the white cat and thus determine its state, you learn
nothing about the state of the black cat. The cats are therefore not entangled.

Again, we have two cats: one white and one black. Their combined state is a superposition of
the states 'both cats are dead' and 'both cats are alive'. If you look at the white cat and thus
determine that it is dead, the state of the black cat instantly becomes 'dead' as well. If you
observe that the white cat is alive, the black cat instantly becomes 'alive' as well, even if it is far
removed from the white one. That is called entanglement.

Tale/innlegg | Dato: 12.05.2025
Av: Forsknings- og høyere utdanningsminister Sigrun Aasland
Åpningstale på Simula-konferansen Quantum Information
Technology Norway
Ladies and gentlemen, dear friends and colleagues,
Thank you for the invitation, thank you to the organisers Simula, Sigma2 and
OsloMet, and to Simula for hosting this workshop on an increasingly
important topic. As the recent Evaluation of Mathematics, ICT and
Technology in Norway pointed out, Norway has many strengths, but needs to
speed up and get into new technology areas – such as AI and quantum
computing. The same evaluation also showed that Simula is one of the
leading research environments in information technology in Norway.
We are, in other words, at the right place. And we are certainly talking about
quantum technology at the right time.
It’s challenging to fully grasp the implications of the technological
development that we now are witnessing in real time. OECD’s January paper
on quantum technologies, A Quantum Technologies Policy Primer, presents
benefits to be unlocked, for example improved quality of medical imaging
and diagnosis, which can be a significant contribution in medicine. Another
example is the use of quantum simulation algorithms in chemistry and
materials science to improve the development of renewable energy
technologies. There are countless other possibilities.
But we can’t underestimate the potential for misuse and significant damage.
For example, in the domain of security and preparedness. In the future,
powerful quantum computers might be able to bypass today’s cryptology
and give intruders access to critical data and systems. On the other hand,
quantum technology can also be used to design new and more advanced
encryption, and better protect critical infrastructure and data from cyber-
attacks. One example, from a catalogue of 16 Danish use cases given to me
by Denmark’s Ambassador Louise Jespersen after a meeting in March, is a
Quantum Random Number Generator. It has been developed by the Danish
company Alea Quantum Technologies and can be used to improve digital
security.
The same potential for good and bad goes for artificial intelligence, a
powerful tool for new and smarter solutions, for example in pattern
recognition in big data. And at the same time, an enabler for false
information, manipulation and propaganda. Moreover, from an environmental
perspective, training AI-models consumes huge amounts of electricity. With
future quantum computers, this problem may be reduced.
In June of last year, the United Nations proclaimed 2025 as the International
Year of Quantum Science and Technology, to commemorate that the first
scientific theories of quantum physics were published in 1925.
Quantum physics has in the last century revolutionized our understanding of
the fundamental principles of physics. Or at least your understanding, the
scientists and academics, who are actually capable of understanding this
extremely complex field.
Now, we have arrived at what appears to be the second quantum revolution,
at the point where quantum mechanics may lead to profound changes of our
societies. To face this development head on, our neighbours and friends,
Denmark and Finland, have created their own national strategies for quantum
technology, and we expect Sweden to very soon follow suit. So, you could
very well argue that it’s about time that we have a strategy of our own.
Through a joint effort by the Ministry of Education and Research and the
Ministry of Defence, the government this year increased the annual funding
for quantum technology research by 70 million kroner. The Research Council
is planning a call for applications in the near future. In our recent White Paper
to Parliament about the research system, we announced that we would now
start working on a Norwegian strategy for quantum technology.
So why is it important to develop a quantum strategy?
Because quantum technologies have the power to change business models,
power balances and how we live our daily life – as well as enabling giant
leaps in research and other fields.
The government believes that Norway needs a broad strategy for research,
innovation and business development within quantum technology, as well as
security and international cooperation. The strategy must particularly
emphasize research where Norway has advantages, or where the needs are
greatest.
Such a strategy must see knowledge development and commercialization
together. The understanding of quantum technology cannot be limited to the
technology itself. It must also include knowledge about society, market
mechanisms, security, frontier research and understanding of disruptive
changes.
It is crucial that the strategic process involves both the academic field, and
the public and private sectors. Our goal is to identify the areas with the
greatest potential for innovation and societal benefit.
To achieve this, we have asked The Research Council of Norway, Innovation
Norway and the Norwegian National Security Authority to prepare a
knowledge base for the strategy work. The knowledge base will include a
mapping of existing activity, a mapping of areas that may be affected, and a
mapping of security challenges and security measures.
We have also asked the three agencies for proposals for priority areas,
proposals for new and innovative approaches to the commercialisation of
research results and proposals for international cooperation. Throughout this
process, the agencies shall involve relevant actors from the research system
and the public and private sectors.
I’m sure many of you here today will be involved in this important work, and I
encourage you to participate actively.
The knowledge base shall be completed by the end of November. Once the
knowledge base is ready, a consortium of ministries will develop the strategy.
This work might benefit from lessons learned from the strategy processes in
Denmark, Finland and Sweden, which I look forward to learning more about
from the next speakers. Our strategy will be presented in 2026.
Let me close by acknowledging the importance of international cooperation:
Although we have leading researchers and institutions in Norway – many of
whom are present here today – and we excel in some fields, such as sensor
technology, we are a small country with limited resources. We need to and
we want to cooperate, as we also do in many other fields of research. A
quantum strategy which highlights Norway's strengths, will increase the
opportunities for Norwegian actors to participate in international cooperation,
particularly in the Nordic region.
The Nordic Quantum Network and the collaboration between the Niels Bohr
Institute and the University of Oslo are two examples of Nordic cooperation.
The many contributions from Nordic colleagues to this conference, is another
example.
Denmark has taken the initiative to develop the Nordic region as a
coordinated quantum region, including to collaborate on education and
research and to attract research talent and venture capital. The Nordic
countries boast strong quantum ecosystems with world-class scholars, a
growing quantum industry and globally leading public-private partnerships.
We can all gain from closer Nordic collaboration, and several Norwegian
ministries are currently working on a declaration of collaboration with their
sister ministries in the Nordic countries.
So, while Norway may be a slow starter, we are striving to become a fast
mover. The next years will be exciting, and I look forward to working together
with you.
Let’s harness our quantum potential together!
Thank you.

Foreword by Trevor Cross
The university laboratories of the United Kingdom have seen
some ground-breaking work in quantum physics over the last
20 years. Across the globe, there are more than 7000 active
researchers and an annual investment of €1.5bn. Now is the time
to turn that work into new products and services that could
change our lives and drive significant economic growth in the UK.
The UK punches above its weight in this area and, in 2013, our
government recognised this opportunity when it announced a

We published a national strategy earlier this year to guide public
and private work and investment in quantum technologies.
The publication of this roadmap is part of that strategy. It was
drawn up following a series of workshops that involved
representatives of business, academia and public funders.
This roadmap is for anyone with an interest in this emerging
sector, particularly business. It shows companies where new
opportunities in quantum technologies overlap with their
interests and helps them to understand how these new
applications could drive their growth. It also highlights the
challenges and barriers that must be overcome if we are to make
UK businesses world-leading in new quantum technologies.
If you are not already involved, find out more about the
quantum technologies programme by reading this roadmap
and the national strategy. Join us at the Quantum Technologies
Special Interest Group and help to shape the future of this
emerging industry. And get involved with EPSRC’s quantum
hubs and the publicly-funded activities of Innovate UK.
Quantum science promises to have a major impact on the
finance, defence, aerospace, energy and telecommunications
sectors. I look forward to seeing that happen and the part
we will all play in maximizing the benefits in and for the UK.

National strategy for
quantum technologies
Preserving the UK advantage
It is widely acknowledged that the UK approach of supporting
close co-working between industry and academia to develop
devices for multiple sectors is unique. The national programme
will take advantage of this head start and work to create an
environment that draws companies and innovative people to
the UK to do business, while looking to achieve a lead in this
large and promising future global industry.
We will:
O use our investment to create an environment that motivates
UK and international companies to do business in the UK,
including creating incubation spaces and offering public
funding to de-risk developments
O ensure that our intellectual property is protected through
patents, trade secrets or non-disclosure agreements
O grow a global industry for quantum technologies while also
preserving our own advantage through a full understanding
of the opportunities and risks in each collaboration, before
we proceed
Export controls
We must take care that export controls do not have an impact
on the success of the UK quantum technologies programme.
The US is already a well-established player in quantum research
and atomic clock manufacture, and is expected to apply
extra-territorial export restrictions, such as International Traffic
in Arms regulations (ITAR), to systems and components that
incorporate its intellectual property.
Similarly, the UK may impose export controls [21] on new devices.
A list of items that may be subject to restrictions is available from
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills [22].

National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science
About the National Science and Technology Council
The National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) is the principal means by which the Executive
Branch coordinates science and technology policy across the diverse entities that make up the Federal
research and development enterprise. A primary objective of the NSTC is to ensure science and
technology policy decisions and programs are consistent with the President's stated goals. The NSTC
prepares research and development strategies that are coordinated across Federal agencies aimed at
accomplishing multiple national goals. The work of the NSTC is organized under committees that
oversee subcommittees and working groups focused on different aspects of science and technology.
More information is available at http://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/nstc.
About the Office of Science and Technology Policy
The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) was established by the National Science and
Technology Policy, Organization, and Priorities Act of 1976 to provide the President and others within
the Executive Office of the President with advice on the scientific, engineering, and technological
aspects of the economy, national security, homeland security, health, foreign relations, the
environment, and the technological recovery and use of resources, among other topics. OSTP leads
interagency science and technology policy coordination efforts, assists the Office of Management and
Budget with an annual review and analysis of Federal research and development in budgets, and serves
as a source of scientific and technological analysis and judgment for the President with respect to major
policies, plans, and programs of the Federal Government. More information is available at
https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp.
About the Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science
The NSTC Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science (SCQIS) coordinates Federal research and
development (R&D) in quantum information science and related technologies under the auspices of the
NSTC’s Committee on Science. This coordinated R&D aims to ensure that U.S. leadership in quantum
information science and its applications is maintained and expanded over the next decade.

National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science
1 Quantum information science: the next technological revolution
Quantum information science (QIS) applies the best understanding of the sub-atomic world—quantum
theory—to generate new knowledge and technologies. Through developments in QIS, the United States
can improve its industrial base, create jobs, and provide economic and national security benefits. Prior
examples of QIS-related technologies include semiconductor microelectronics, photonics, the global
positioning system (GPS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These underpin significant parts of
the national economic and defense infrastructure. Future scientific and technological discoveries from
QIS may be even more impactful. Long-running U.S. Government investments in QIS and more recent
industry involvement have transformed this scientific field into a nascent pillar of the American
research and development enterprise. The Trump administration is committed to maintaining and
expanding American leadership in QIS to enable future long-term benefits from, and protection of, the
science and technology created through this research. Based on the collective input of all the
Government agencies invested or interested in QIS, this document presents a national strategic
approach to achieving this goal.
Specifically, the United States will create a visible, systematic, national approach to quantum
information research and development, organized under a single brand and coordinated by the
National Science and Technology Council’s (NSTC) Subcommittee on Quantum Information Science
(SCQIS). These efforts will leverage existing programs and approaches, adapt to the changing and
improving scientific and technical knowledge, reflect the best understanding of opportunities and
challenges in QIS for the Nation, and take new steps where appropriate. The national effort will:
 Focus on a science-first approach that aims to identify and solve Grand Challenges: problems
whose solutions enable transformative scientific and industrial progress;
 Build a quantum-smart and diverse workforce to meet the needs of a growing field;
 Encourage industry engagement, providing appropriate mechanisms for public-private
partnerships;
 Provide the key infrastructure and support needed to realize the scientific and technological
opportunities;
 Drive economic growth;
 Maintain national security; and
 Continue to develop international collaboration and cooperation.
The key next step will be to develop agency-level plans that address the identified approaches and
policy opportunities in the next section, which will be integrated into an overall strategic plan. This will
enable new opportunities on a ten-year horizon, possibly including: the development of quantum
processors which may enable limited computing applications; new sensors for biotechnology and
defense; next-generation positioning, navigation, and timing systems for military and commercial
applications; new approaches to understanding materials, chemistry, and even gravity through
quantum information theory; novel algorithms for machine learning and optimization; and
transformative cyber security systems including quantum-resistant cryptography in response to
developments in QIS.

3 Challenges this strategic overview addresses
The rapid growth of QIS and the expectation that this trajectory will continue over the next decade
create unique opportunities and challenges for the U.S. research and development enterprise.
Underscoring the Trump Administration’s commitment to advancing QIS, the NSTC elevated its work
on the subject and established the SCQIS, which has identified four key challenges that need to be
addressed with a whole-of-Government response.
First, improving and facilitating coordination both within the Government and between public and
private institutions will create a robust domestic ecosystem and provide worldwide leadership in this
international environment. The Nation already has strong and diverse programs in QIS at the Federal-
agency level driven by individual mission spaces, as described in the Appendix. Similarly, companies
have begun making major investments in the field, inspired by the promise of future applications. At
the same time, foreign countries are making investments and seeking to build their own QIS base in
competition with the United States. Coordinating U.S. efforts will take advantage of the Government
and industry activities to maintain and accelerate U.S. leadership in QIS.
Second, growth within industry, academia, and Government requires maintaining and expanding a
broad and viable workforce—a quantum-smart workforce—able to enact critical elements of the
research and development enterprise. Such a workforce will attract and retain key jobs throughout the
Nation, and enable new industrial and academic efforts that rely upon QIS as a base technology.
Third, future progress in QIS requires strong cross-community connections between disciplines, from
physics to computer science to engineering. These interactions already occur through research
collaborations, but would benefit further from formal interdisciplinary research and training programs
at earlier levels of education. As growth continues, collaborations and cooperation—between
disciplines and nations, between industry and academia—must be promoted, even as competitive
pressures may make this more difficult.
Fourth, significant uncertainty remains regarding the overall economic and national security impact of
QIS research and development. With strong industrial engagement now beginning, it is crucial to
maintain a culture of discovery. The likely best-use commercial cases of quantum devices are unknown
at this time and must be found through research. Maintaining this focus, despite significant
countervailing pressures, is necessary. The technologies that are anticipated to result from this
approach may also play a role in solutions to some of the Nation’s most pressing national security
concerns, but will require maintaining an understanding of national security implications of QIS.
In order to maintain and expand American leadership in this critical technology given these challenges,
we must improve our capacity for cutting edge research and development, expand the QIS-literate
workforce, and seamlessly coordinate between government, academic, and private sector players.
4 Choosing a science-first approach to QIS
Quantum information science—including concepts and technology that support revolutionary
advances in computing, communications, and metrology—arises from a synthesis of quantum
mechanics and information theory. It examines uniquely quantum phenomena that can be harnessed
to advance information processing, transmission, measurement, and fundamental understanding in
ways that classical approaches can only do much less efficiently, or not at all. Current and future QIS
applications differ from prior applications of quantum mechanics, such as the laser, transistor and MRI,
5
National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science
by using distinct quantum phenomena—superposition and entanglement—that do not have classical
counterparts.
Even though its origins can be traced back to the 1960’s, QIS remains a rapidly evolving scientific and
engineering discipline with substantial further discovery opportunities awaiting. This reflects the
Government’s long support of basic research and development in this field. Even now, while prototype
QIS applications, platforms and devices are becoming commercially available, new applications and
platforms will likely come from protocols and approaches that are not yet invented. Thus, the
Government should maintain robust and diverse platforms and research thrusts that continue to
stimulate transformative and fundamental scientific discoveries by taking an approach that puts
the science first. This will require strengthening core research programs and finding new methods to
broaden collaboration and participation.
To capitalize on QIS-inspired technologies and advance the science necessary to realize the associated
gains, the development and pursuit of scientific and applied Grand Challenges will be the unifying
strategy. Grand Challenges are those fundamental scientific or technology problems with answers that
will be transformative for Nation and have broad economic and scientific impact. Potential solutions
will take sustained investments for at least ten years and require multidisciplinary teams of researchers
and technologists. Agencies, academia, and industry must work together to identify and prioritize
Grand Challenges, as well as track their progress and reevaluate these scientific and technological
opportunities as the research and development progress.

5 Creating a quantum-smart workforce for tomorrow
Growing an American quantum-smart workforce with expertise in a broad range of physical,
information, and engineering sciences is crucial for assuring sustained progress in QIS. However,
America’s current educational system typically focuses on discrete disciplinary tracks, rarely
emphasizing cross-disciplinary study that equips graduates for complex modern questions and
challenges, prominently including QIS. While the responsibility of training students traditionally resides
within the academic community, Government agencies and industry can partner with academia to
meet the nation’s future needs.
Fundamental research is the main mechanism for generating a qualified workforce in QIS. Within the
context of the need for individuals with a broad mix of skills, support for the trans-sector and trans-
disciplinary approach to research is essential. Students trained in such an environment will be exposed
to a diverse yet convergent set of disciplines, along with the associated tools and infrastructure. This
will allow students to obtain qualifications and skills required by U.S. industry, national laboratories,
and academia. Existing approaches of this nature include special research tracks in academic
programs, early career awards from Government agencies, support for focused research groups, and
coordinated training with industry. Using and enhancing these programs can increase the size of the
QIS workforce. Furthermore, approaches that synthesize these programs, such as industrial
collaborations that engaging with a central, fundamental research program, can prepare students with
additional skills crucial to entering the workforce in the private sector to further U.S. leadership in
quantum science and technology.
Agencies will be encouraged to expand or develop specific programs that foster workforce
development and build off each other’s strengths and mission. A number of agencies already have
existing programs, such as the National Science Foundation’s (NSF) Graduate Research Fellowship
Program and the Accelerating Discovery Program; the National Defense Science and Engineering
Graduate Fellowship Program and the Quantum Science and Engineering Program at the Department
of Defense (DOD); Science Undergraduate Laboratory internships, the Graduate Student Research
Program, and the Computational Science Graduate Fellowship Program at the Department of Energy
(DOE); and the National Institute of Standards and Technology’s (NIST) joint research centers that
combine Government researchers with university students, postdoctoral scholars, and faculty. These
programs can be enriched, modified, and expanded when driven by agency need. Further
improvements may include joining existing efforts of different agencies to increase impact, such as by
creating joint early-career programs.
Looking to the longer-term horizon, academic faculty provide the bedrock of training programs.
Universities should be encouraged to address the workforce development needs by adding tenured or
tenure-track faculty within the interdisciplinary themes associated with QIS and consider Quantum
Science and Engineering as a discipline for future concentration, exemplified in steps such as creating
new departments or thesis tracks. Other avenues include new undergraduate programs, engagement
with industry and Government for internships and externships—predominantly for U.S. persons—and
new professional development programs, including encouragement for creation of specialized
technical programs. These students become ambassadors of their discipline while following a wide
range of different paths in their careers, increasing the societal impact of quantum-science education.
Beyond the university, outreach to a broader audience will be essential. A strong comprehensive
program in K-12 computational and scientific thinking featuring computer science and physics must
start with developing interest at an early stage. A critical role can be played by industry, professional

those found in many museums across the
Nation, are effective and complementary to the classroom. These overall efforts work best in
coordination with the NSTC Committee on STEM and its subcommittees that address STEM and related
education.
Workforce generation efforts and future U.S. workforce needs of the nascent quantum industry should
be periodically assessed, through industrial engagement (described in the following section) and work
with established STEM efforts. This information can help guide future programs to produce the diverse
workforce needed to support the quantum ecosystem. In order to improve the workforce development
program over time, an assessment plan of quantum workforce development activities should be
encouraged to allow participants to select and expand the most successful strategies and adapt,
change, or terminate what does not work. Collaboration with professional societies and organizations,
industrial consortia, and local governments are other means of assessing workforce needs.
6 Deepening engagement with quantum industry
The revolutionary advances expected to come from QIS have already led to substantial industry
attention on QIS research and development. Both large companies and a variety of startups and small
businesses are investing heavily in quantum sensing, networking, computing, and supporting
technologies. Several have already realized or will soon unveil next-generation quantum sensors,
entanglement distribution over small networks, and quantum processors in the 50-qubit range, with
plans to continue on a rapid-growth trajectory. In view of the economic and national security
importance of QIS the Government will develop means to coordinate with U.S. industry.
A critical element in a robust quantum ecosystem is a strong base of quantum-essential supporting
technologies that are not intrinsically quantum in themselves. Current examples include cryogenics,
photonics, low-noise microwave amplifiers, and nanofabrication. Thus the consortium should work to
identify and stay abreast of these evolving needs, as well as work in partnership with Government
agencies and industry to nurture and grow these technologies in cases where they are weak or do not
yet exist. Existing approaches such as SBIR and STTR programs that promote innovation for small
businesses can be integrated with or combined with other approaches such as joint research centers.
In addition, as a key mechanism for industry engagement, the Government should foster the formation
of a U.S. Quantum Consortium with participants from industry, academia, and Government. Like prior
consortia such as the Semiconductor Research Corporation, a consortium provides a forum for
technical exchanges and discussions to establish a mutual understanding of QIS industry’s trajectory,
opportunities, and critical technical gaps and projected needs (e.g., for workforce, infrastructure,
standards, and road-mapping). Furthermore, the consortium can also provide a venue for joint public-
private funding to address infrastructure and technology gaps, and key pre-competitive research and

President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, as well as coordination with other NSTC
subcommittees.

accelerate pre-competitive QIS research and development, and in the process help address both the
looming need for a greatly expanded and diverse quantum workforce and scientific and applied Grand
Challenges. These centers can also facilitate and improve technology transfer from Government
research labs. More generally, mechanisms such as incubators for translation from the lab to small
companies should be expanded, and roadblocks removed where possible. For a meaningful
collaboration environment to exist, intellectual property concerns will also need to be addressed and
methods for realizing the development technology emphasized where possible.
7 Providing critical infrastructure
The successful development of technologies based on QIS will enable increasingly more advanced
quantum research, but hinges on the availability of suitable tools, facilities, and other infrastructure
items. The QIS research and development enterprise is not yet large enough to sustain an industry
focused on developing and supplying all the necessary infrastructure. A targeted expansion of the
relevant Federal and industrial infrastructure and support activities is needed to accelerate progress
and prepare Federal agencies and industry to adopt the ensuing quantum technologies.
The U.S. Government can play a critical role in fostering this field by encouraging programs that target
the development and fielding of supporting technologies, ranging from component technologies all the
way to sophisticated fabrication and characterization technologies. Agencies will be encouraged to
explore mechanisms to provide the QIS research community with increased access to existing and
future Federal facilities, including manufacturing facilities that can be repurposed and expanded as
well as systems and testbeds for post-quantum applications. As some of these infrastructure

effectiveness of investments being made. In accordance with evolving needs, these efforts should be
on-going.
In addition to bolstering infrastructure, it is important to nurture the adoption of quantum technologies
within the Federal Government by cultivating potential end-user agencies. A culture of information
sharing has sprung up organically among the personnel at the Federal agencies funding QIS and those
looking to leverage future applications. The Government will encourage this culture, and the inter-
agency process will provide a sounding board for promulgating such shared interest and promoting the
leveraging of Federal investments in advancing each agency’s mission. Furthermore, it will explore
methods to spur engagement from those end-user agencies that have not yet played a role in
developing the technology, but could benefit from the output of this research. Indeed, the impact of
QIS will be felt broadly, and it will be important for each agency to be aware of how the quantum
revolution may augment its mission space. The establishment of end-user testbed facilities along with
training and engagement will allow Federal agencies and stakeholders to explore relevant applications.
10
National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science
8 Maintaining national security and economic growth
National security needs often drive the advancement of new science and technology and enable
economic development through enhanced Government investments, dedicated initiatives, and cross-
agency collaborations. At the same time, creating new markets and industries enhance our ability to
address national security needs, but the scientific and economic advances can lead to new risks. An
appropriate balance between growth and risk can provide long-term benefits.
The technologies that are anticipated to result from intensified research and development in QIS may
provide solutions to some of the nation’s most pressing national security concerns. For example,
advancements in quantum computing may allow for improvements in effective drug discovery,
modeling of chemical reactions to enhance corrosion-resistant materials, and optimizing logistics
solutions. These and other opportunities in networking and sensing can play a positive role in ensuring
national security and defense.
However, there may be challenges to public safety and security that arise from these same
technologies. For example, one key quantum algorithm will be able to break public-key cryptography,
which secures transactions over the internet. While employing this algorithm is far beyond the current
level of technology, the need to protect sensitive data and provide a reliable infrastructure over the
long-term requires moving to “post-quantum” or “quantum-resistant” forms of cryptography.
QIS technologies being developed for military and defense applications can also accelerate
advancements in the field, leading to substantial economic growth potential through the creation of
new industries and products and their transition to consumer markets. The defense and intelligence
communities have been strong investors in QIS research and development over the last twenty years,
and continue to work across the basic science and applied technology areas to improve the
understanding of what is possible with QIS and support the necessary technological base. Enhanced
industrial engagement and infrastructure improvements described in the previous sections will also

Thus the SCQIS will, in conjunction with
other NSTC subcommittees, Federal agencies, and the defense and intelligence communities, ensure
consistent application of existing classification and export control mechanisms to provide the largest
amount of information possible to American universities and industry about actions related to QIS
research.
9 Advancing international cooperation
Science, technology, and innovation are cornerstones of U.S. prosperity and economic development
and also dominant forces internationally, particularly given the highly interconnected world of the 21st
century, where businesses operate globally and scientists and engineers collaborate across borders.
Considering the global nature of scientific and industrial enterprises, the United States, including the
private sector, has cooperated with foreign partners in QIS research for more than twenty years. These
partnerships have accelerated scientific discovery and technological applications while promoting U.S.
economic growth and national security.
In order to maintain U.S. leadership and competitiveness in QIS, the United States must work with
international partners, even while advancing domestic investments and research strategies. As
discoveries accelerate in all sectors, the United States should seek to increase international
cooperation with like-minded governments and industrial partners to ensure that technologies
resulting from today’s investments in basic research and technological development continue to
12
National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science
benefit Americans. Sustained domestic investments and strategic international collaboration and
cooperation will be vital to this goal.
The Government will focus on three strategic international efforts for QIS. The first effort will be regular
reviews of international collaboration activities and partnerships, to identify and track worldwide QIS
science and technology trends and identify gaps and opportunities, understand the evolving
international QIS landscape, and inform existing programs. Second, the Government will identify and
prioritize strategic bilateral partnerships to ensure that the United States continues to attract and
retain the best international and has access to international technologies, research facilities, and
experts in QIS. Third, the Government should encourage merit-based and transparent fundamental
research and innovation systems, and open access to public data arising from QIS research, as
appropriate, as well as to advance the development of international standards that enable adoption of
new QIS-inspired technologies.
13

Appendix: Current U.S. leadership in QIS research areas
The United States sustains a vibrant community in QIS. World-leading research groups in the Nation’s
universities, companies, and national labs have driven progress in many of the critical areas of quantum
computing and quantum systems for time-keeping, sensing, networking, and other applications. This
status as a leader in quantum research and development is a direct result of the U.S. Government
funding agencies and institutions sustained investment in basic and applied research. Both broad and
focused programs, built atop a foundation of well-staffed and well-equipped research institutions, have
created a talented workforce, encouraged broad innovation and exploration, and dedicated the
necessary hard work in physics, materials science, and associated areas necessary to make progress in
the development of working, controllable quantum systems. Throughout this effort, the United States
has benefited from a many-headed funding model where, for example, one Agency continues to fund
critical topics as another changes focus. Furthermore, combining funding driven by mission needs to
ensure long-term development with science-driven funding to create the new ideas that seed further
innovation provides additional resiliency.
Progress in QIS has recently begun a significant expansion from increases in private sector research and
development. Over the last five years, particularly in quantum computing, large IT companies and the
venture capital and start-up community have engaged with new QIS opportunities and formed groups
and companies to pursue commercialization. It should be noted that all this is possible because of the
wealth and know-how that these companies and communities gained from the previous computing
and internet revolutions they helped create. The national strategic approach should continue to
leverage these strengths of both the U.S. Government funding system and the U.S. innovation
ecosystem.
Finally, significant contributions to QIS research have been made in other countries. The field has
advanced in the United States in some part by recruiting, collaborating, and competing with science
around the world. As a case in point, the first two-qubit gate proposal came from researchers in Europe,
but was demonstrated in the Nobel-prize winning group of David Wineland at NIST. This reflects the
increasingly global character of the science and technology enterprise. In a field where scientists are
still very much fighting nature itself to make progress, humanity’s combined effort may be necessary to
tackle the challenge. U.S. leadership at this juncture will provide the key ingredients for this success.
QIS comprises fundamental science and technology across many platforms and topics, and touches
upon many agencies. This includes the Department of Agriculture (USDA), Department of Defense
(DOD), Department of Energy (DOE), National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of the Interior
(DOI), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of State (State), National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), National Science
Foundation (NSF), National Security Agency (NSA), Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI),
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).
The SCQIS assesses the national portfolio using seven broad categories: four in fundamental science
(S1-S4) and three in technological development (T1-T3).
S1. Quantum sensing: leveraging quantum mechanics to enhance the fundamental accuracy of
measurements and/or enabling new regimes or modalities for sensors and measurement
science [DOD, DOE, DHS, DOI, NIST, NSF, ODNI]

National Strategic Overview for Quantum Information Science
S2. Quantum computing: from devices and algorithms for analog simulation of quantum systems
in the laboratory to controlled digital quantum computers [DOD, DOE, NASA, NIST, NSF,
NSA, ODNI]
S3. Quantum networking: exploring and using coherent or entangled multi-party quantum states,
distributed at distances, for new information technology applications and fundamental
science [DOD, NASA, NIST, NSF]
S4. Scientific advances enabled by quantum devices and theory advances: improved
understanding of materials, chemistry, cosmology, classical computation techniques, and
other aspects of fundamental science [DOE, NIST, NSF]
T1. Supporting technology: necessary analog, digital, electrical, mechanical, optical,
computational, and cryogenic systems and techniques that underpin the fundamental science
areas [DOD, NASA, NIST, NSF, NSA, ODNI]
T2. Future applications: opportunities for improvements in operations research, optimization,
machine learning, drug discovery, etc. [all SCQIS agencies engaged]
T3. Risk mitigation: necessary infrastructure and support for quantum technologies and their
impact, such as quantum-resistant cryptosystems and other post-quantum applications
[DHS, NIST, NSA]
The Nation’s efforts in these areas include a number of agencies that have over the years driven
research and development in these seven categories. Current Federal agencies conducting or funding
these topic areas are identified above. These seven areas represent the broad foundation necessary to
support a full industrial and Governmental effort in quantum information science and technology. The
SCQIS also has examined current funding, and finds at the present time that it is primarily focused on
S1-S4, as shown in the graph below.

Through Research
and Resilience
August 2025
Executive Summary
Vietnam isnʼt making much noise in the quantum race—and thatʼs
exactly the point. Instead of hype cycles, itʼs taking a steady,
deliberate approach: leveraging its strengths in math and science,
developing a new generation of tech talent, and focusing on its
broader goal of digital sovereignty.
2025 is shaping up to be a pivotal year. Research networks are
coming together. The government is planning for the long term. And
cross-border collaborations are accelerating. For Vietnam, quantum
isnʼt just a trend—itʼs part of a broader strategy for scientific
credibility and technological resilience.
National Strategy & Infrastructure
Vietnam doesnʼt have a national quantum strategy yet—but the
groundwork is quietly being laid.
